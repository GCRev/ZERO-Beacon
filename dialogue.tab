ch_adam_810db67f	adam	[last_dialog]	game/ch_adam.rpy	11
ch_adam_5d3e994a	adam	Hello! Or as the kaldreans say "kevey"! Welcome to my humble living space and please make yourself comfortable. I'm always happy to meet new people! I'm Adam by the way.	game/ch_adam.rpy	14
ch_adam_cf0f4831	p	It's a pleasure to meet you Adam. I'm [alias.full]. But if we're on a first name basis, you can just call me [alias.first].	game/ch_adam.rpy	15
ch_adam_d6540aa7	adam	Likewise, [alias.first]. If there is anything I can get you just let me know, or perhaps you just want to ask some questions? I'm always open to converse.	game/ch_adam.rpy	16
ch_adam_ffd287d8	adam	I haven't seen you around, are you a new arrival?	game/ch_adam.rpy	18
ch_adam_afc4ff76	p	I am.	game/ch_adam.rpy	19
ch_adam_810db67f_1	adam	[last_dialog]	game/ch_adam.rpy	22
menu_adam_68e701ee	adam	[last_dialog]	game/ch_adam.rpy	27
adam_advice_f9d18705	p	Do you have any advice for a citizen new to Concord - particularly a diplomat?	game/ch_adam.rpy	46
adam_advice_915d8f6f	adam	To us, here, the person that you were before you arrived does not necessarily shape you.	game/ch_adam.rpy	48
adam_advice_f8f58bdf	adam	I have learned slowly but surely that the dynamic here is far different than Earth, the wonderful planet upon which I grew up.	game/ch_adam.rpy	50
adam_advice_f41f9f0d	adam	There, you are what you were – the person that is you becomes what others can gather by looking at your past.	game/ch_adam.rpy	52
adam_advice_361cee56	p	And the dynamic here is far different.	game/ch_adam.rpy	54
adam_advice_428c5792	adam	Exactly. Simply by saying that you've shown how it impresses upon you. Here, you are what you make yourself – we have the kaldreans to thank for this.	game/ch_adam.rpy	56
adam_advice_f117f483	adam	They judge based on ends rather than means. Not the best, but certainly different. But you can see that it has rubbed off on us.	game/ch_adam.rpy	58
adam_advice_1116630b	adam	Asking about one's past is generally regarded as very personal information to kaldreans – so be careful when jumping into this topic... anyone.	game/ch_adam.rpy	60
adam_advice_54de21fd	adam	Some will be ready and willing to share, others... not so much.	game/ch_adam.rpy	62
adam_advice_81399f57	p	And how do you find this - exchange?	game/ch_adam.rpy	64
adam_advice_ab240d23	adam	Personally, I do not mind it. I think it suits this new beacon of hope to have an entirely new culture to both races.	game/ch_adam.rpy	66
adam_advice_d8a3ffd9	p	Of course.	game/ch_adam.rpy	68
adam_events_f7cc920e	p	You seem like you're in the know about recent events. What do you think about these tensions?	game/ch_adam.rpy	74
adam_events_d69ede72	adam	It seems like a ploy to me - someone is looking for problems and they are eager to place blame wherever it may settle.	game/ch_adam.rpy	76
adam_events_8e0ce8ca	p	You think that someone is creating this tension on purpose.	game/ch_adam.rpy	78
adam_events_38b99a88	adam	There is such a thing as ambient tension, but then there is the reek of hate that clings to what we call "rumors."	game/ch_adam.rpy	80
adam_events_daeefe63	adam	I can smell it - and believe me, I know it because I've experienced it before. Concord, while a beacon for galactic peace, is equally fragile.	game/ch_adam.rpy	82
adam_events_7205f1e8	adam	Only fifty years a settlement - if I can remember its inception, then it is NOT old enough to be entirely stable.	game/ch_adam.rpy	84
adam_events_ee159fb4	adam	I only hope that this tension passes quickly, because the last thing we need now is another conflict we cannot weasel our way out of.	game/ch_adam.rpy	86
adam_alkay_dialog_1c3f696e	p	Actually, Alkay wanted me to talk to you.	game/ch_adam.rpy	92
adam_alkay_dialog_22908d56	adam	Yes, of course, any friend of Alkay is a friend of mine! What would you like to know, [alias.first]?	game/ch_adam.rpy	94
adam_alkay_dialog_b28ea849	p	Well, he mentioned a little bit about how you two met, what was your perspective?	game/ch_adam.rpy	96
adam_alkay_dialog_1f462455	adam	That's not something I'd normally share with strangers, but if Alkay sent you, I'm sure that I can trust you.	game/ch_adam.rpy	98
adam_alkay_dialog_9a37621f	adam	Where to begin... Ah yes. The operation.	game/ch_adam.rpy	100
adam_alkay_dialog_97bf2612	adam	I'll try to keep this as brief as I can so I don't bore you to death.	game/ch_adam.rpy	102
adam_alkay_dialog_4a6ba990	adam	So I was part of the team that made first contact with the kaldreans. I was an engineer on the TSS Armada.	game/ch_adam.rpy	104
adam_alkay_dialog_8065749c	adam	When we first saw the aliens, the whole ship was dead silent for a long time. Seeing another intelligent race was... Wow. I can't even describe the emotion.	game/ch_adam.rpy	106
adam_alkay_dialog_24d65029	adam	But I digress! Anyways, then the fighting broke out. Neither side wanted to fight, but eventually someone pulled the trigger.	game/ch_adam.rpy	108
adam_alkay_dialog_408199c7	adam	Attempts to communicate were futile due to the language and culture barriers.	game/ch_adam.rpy	110
adam_alkay_dialog_cec1f702	adam	Through the process though, I befriended Alkay. He was one of the first kaldreans to learn the human standard.	game/ch_adam.rpy	112
adam_alkay_dialog_7b1e0008	adam	We were practically the emissaries of the time.	game/ch_adam.rpy	114
adam_alkay_dialog_a1c831ab	adam	He was taking a huge risk doing this though. He was going against his leaders to try to stop the fighting. It was very brave of him. Some could argue foolish, but either way he was successful and we live in peace because of it.	game/ch_adam.rpy	116
adam_alkay_dialog_718bbfc3	adam	Alkay and I have been friends ever since.	game/ch_adam.rpy	118
adam_VL_tree_start_88fac75a	p	What can you tell me about Valak Lideri?	game/ch_adam.rpy	126
adam_VL_tree_start_60a73d7d	adam	Well, that's certainly an ambitious question for someone so new to Concord. How did you come across this rumor?	game/ch_adam.rpy	128
adam_VL_tree_start_7789f4cc	adam	I have been here for nearly my entire life and I've only heard whispers of this group's existence. And I have a careful ear.	game/ch_adam.rpy	130
adam_VL_tree_start_119fbc2c	p	I will remind you that I am a diplomat - I was chosen because I too have a careful ear.	game/ch_adam.rpy	132
adam_VL_tree_start_fbfdf652	adam	Ah yes, I see.	game/ch_adam.rpy	134
adam_VL_tree_start_5568d126	p	Probably also a coincidence.	game/ch_adam.rpy	136
adam_VL_tree_start_f8943da8	adam	I can relate to that - I have been involved in my fair share of coincidences throughout my life. So what do you think about this group, based off what you know?	game/ch_adam.rpy	138
adam_VL_tree_start_ed24e2d8	adam	I've heard some conflicting viewpoints on them so I'm curious to know what you think.	game/ch_adam.rpy	139
adam_VL_tree_sympathize_6c2e5e89	p	I think that Valak Lideri have a stronger set of morals than the rest of us give them credit. I still think that they are risking a lot, especially now.	game/ch_adam.rpy	149
adam_VL_tree_sympathize_84677b61	adam	I'd need to understand them better though to give you a solid response, I'm basically just going with what I've been told.	game/ch_adam.rpy	151
adam_VL_tree_sympathize_95906535	adam	It all depends on what you've been told, of course. I agree with you; they are taking a huge risk right now, but they definitely do have a strong moral heading.	game/ch_adam.rpy	153
adam_VL_tree_sympathize_47c33087	adam	Although, assuming they do want to spark a revolution, their apparent itch for chaos does not really make sense.	game/ch_adam.rpy	155
adam_VL_tree_sympathize_f00fbe87	adam	They don't seem like they would be such a violent group, given their morals.	game/ch_adam.rpy	157
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_c77e2189	p	Hopefully they don't resort to violence - the change they want to impart on this scale... it is still too fragile.	game/ch_adam.rpy	166
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_e6cf1d55	adam	What you have to understand, is that there is always a time for peace and for violence. If my experiences during the first contact conflict and the years following were anything to go by...	game/ch_adam.rpy	168
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_c9033f59	adam	Look, you'll be told that a peaceful resolution is always the best answer. But when you come down with a disease, let's say, you terminate with medicine because it is a pest.	game/ch_adam.rpy	170
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_91c1da2c	adam	The same goes for establishments. How many have shattered under the scope of a sniper rifle?	game/ch_adam.rpy	172
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_c654b780	p	I can see your point, but establishments and actual people are two completely different things.	game/ch_adam.rpy	174
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_085b50d1	adam	[alias.first], you did not live through the conflict the way I did. Peace works very, very well in the long term. But violence is a quick way to solve immediate problems - strategy versus tactics.	game/ch_adam.rpy	176
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_8f4583fb	adam	You don't have to agree with me, we all have our separate opinions and backgrounds to inform them, but this is the way I have seen it work in the past.	game/ch_adam.rpy	178
adam_VL_tree_nowhere_ee503f76	adam	Valak Lideri, if I could make any guesses, have found their way, and they are willing to pursue it with great force. For a rebel group to  even become a rumor, they must have good cause and powerful people in the background.	game/ch_adam.rpy	180
adam_VL_tree_care_less_5a33b1e9	p	I don't care too much about how they go about pulling this off. As long as their intentions are strong and directed, what will come of it will be good.	game/ch_adam.rpy	188
adam_VL_tree_care_less_c9986126	adam	Sometimes we have to make concessions for the greater good - I found that out the hard way during the first contact conflict.	game/ch_adam.rpy	190
adam_VL_tree_care_less_2da41993	adam	You begin to question what you know about morality when lives are called into question.	game/ch_adam.rpy	191
adam_VL_tree_care_less_bb7dfb49	p	I understand.	game/ch_adam.rpy	193
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_69d17cd1	p	I don't really know what to think of them, I haven't heard too much. In general, though, rebel groups like these compromise the peace that we all work so hard to keep afloat.	game/ch_adam.rpy	202
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_2306122f	adam	While they all have their justifications and sometimes they make perfect sense, ultimately their very existence counteracts the change they seek.	game/ch_adam.rpy	204
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_09ebf4f9	adam	Hm... there are many examples where history supports your assertion, but sometimes these groups have noticed something fundamentally wrong, and they are simply trying to do what is best.	game/ch_adam.rpy	206
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_37570988	adam	During first contact there were suddenly many of these rebel cells who were all fighting for what they thought was right. Some worked to push us away, others to bring us together.	game/ch_adam.rpy	208
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_64d3f6ad	p	So what exactly is your point?	game/ch_adam.rpy	210
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_b7eac7e3	adam	My point is that these rebel groups are not something that you simply sympathize or disagree with - they lie in a moral gray zone in which our own sense of ethics begins to affect our perceptions of them.	game/ch_adam.rpy	212
adam_VL_tree_disapprove_4611acd0	p	Right, that I can agree with.	game/ch_adam.rpy	214
adam_Bg_tree_start_3a12e893	p	What can you tell me about your past? I don't mean to offend, but you look like you've seen quite a great deal of change here.	game/ch_adam.rpy	222
adam_Bg_tree_start_0b717d00	adam	That I have. But actually, I was there when we made first contact. I was a chief engineer aboard the TSS Armada, flagship of Operation Bridge.	game/ch_adam.rpy	224
adam_Bg_tree_start_4bcbf85f	adam	I can still remember my heart swelling with pride seeing Terra disappear behind us as she brought us to the stars.	game/ch_adam.rpy	226
adam_Bg_tree_start_c2769297	adam	Space was not foreign to us, but the distance from home was.	game/ch_adam.rpy	228
adam_Bg_tree_start_4391a911	adam	Nowhere in our minds was the possibility that we could come into contact with another highly-intelligent biped species like our own.	game/ch_adam.rpy	230
adam_Bg_tree_start_c57a3cb5	p	I imagine it was pandemonium when you first saw them?	game/ch_adam.rpy	232
adam_Bg_tree_start_e06991e9	adam	Boy, that moment when we stopped over bridge and saw their fleet, it was silent for a straight ten minutes.	game/ch_adam.rpy	234
adam_Bg_tree_start_97b55b15	adam	From that point on it's history - but I need to be completely clear that neither their commander nor ours wanted the fight to break out.	game/ch_adam.rpy	236
adam_Bg_tree_start_c37d8909	adam	The warning shots eventually turned into full-on fighting. The Verdict was shot down... we took down their ship the Krona... it was a disaster.	game/ch_adam.rpy	238
adam_Bg_tree_start_849b30bc	p	So how did you end up resolving tensions with the kaldreans?	game/ch_adam.rpy	240
adam_Bg_tree_start_cd7f6b1d	adam	It was certainly difficult trying to communicate with one another. We were literally thrust into a completely different culture.	game/ch_adam.rpy	242
adam_Bg_tree_start_59d67a18	adam	We landed here and then we tried to establish some form of communications.	game/ch_adam.rpy	244
adam_Bg_tree_start_8b38b442	adam	Through the process I became friends with a kaldrean, Alkay - wonderful character that one.	game/ch_adam.rpy	246
adam_Bg_tree_start_be405caa	p	So I take it you were around when Concord was constructed.	game/ch_adam.rpy	248
adam_Bg_tree_start_581fdc4b	adam	For the first decade I was actually back on Terra. But I decided to come back here and do my best to facilitate the friendship between the kaldreans and humans.	game/ch_adam.rpy	250
adam_Bg_tree_start_7f5288fd	p	Clearly your work paid off.	game/ch_adam.rpy	252
adam_Bg_tree_start_3ace53d7	adam	You could certainly say that.	game/ch_adam.rpy	254
adam_Bg_tree_Alkay_d5f3a08d	p	You mentioned Alkay?	game/ch_adam.rpy	262
adam_Bg_tree_Alkay_c87c6660	adam	Oh he's been a friend of mine for many years now.	game/ch_adam.rpy	264
adam_Bg_tree_Alkay_d966b1b5	adam	He was actually instrumental in resolving the conflict because he was one of the first kaldreans to learn human standard - probably the first, actually.	game/ch_adam.rpy	266
adam_Bg_tree_Alkay_3d2c5dc2	adam	When I was... when I was working alongside them during the war he and I were unofficial emissaries. When you next stop by Oasis tell him I sent you - he'll be happy to know.	game/ch_adam.rpy	268
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_808021ac	p	So, could you explain your experience in the first contact conflict a little more?	game/ch_adam.rpy	275
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_014c740f	adam	I suppose... although the events that transpired affected quite a few people, including a number of those who live here on Concord.	game/ch_adam.rpy	277
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_3e49a372	adam	I'll try to keep this brief because you really don't need to hear about all the problems.	game/ch_adam.rpy	279
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_64f21cf6	adam	With the Verdict and the Krona damaged beyond repair the rest of our ships landed planet-side because we needed to make repairs.	game/ch_adam.rpy	281
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_9f1ab0ff	adam	Fire was exchanged on the ground despite explicit orders on both sides not to.	game/ch_adam.rpy	283
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_a0d76271	adam	Some of our scouts went missing at about the same time that our people made hostages out of their scouts.	game/ch_adam.rpy	285
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_438bb3f1	adam	It was all quite tense - lives were unnecessarily lost.	game/ch_adam.rpy	287
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_f8d3c444	p	Are you okay?	game/ch_adam.rpy	289
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_96503fb5	adam	Yeah. I'm still upset by how much pain we could have avoided if we had been better prepared. So just always remember, [alias.first], go prepared; you'll never know quite what to expect out there.	game/ch_adam.rpy	291
adam_Bg_tree_conflict_2c467556	p	I'll do my best.	game/ch_adam.rpy	293
ch_ben_d34932bd	ben	I was told we were going to have a new team member. You must be [alias.first].	game/ch_ben.rpy	14
ch_ben_5ef06c7e	p	That is me.	game/ch_ben.rpy	15
ch_ben_e91dad3c	ben	Wonderful. As you might already know, I'm Ambassador Columbus. But please, just call me Ben. I hope that your time on Concord thus far has been pleasant.	game/ch_ben.rpy	16
ch_ben_7bc22752	p	It's a beautiful city.	game/ch_ben.rpy	17
menu_ben_f4f4fa61	ben	[last_dialog]	game/ch_ben.rpy	23
ben_ask_kald_govt_71ba29de	p	I was wondering about your opinion on the state of the kaldrean government.	game/ch_ben.rpy	43
ben_ask_kald_govt_fe19dc12	ben	Their government is stable and provides their people with high standard of living. I do not see anything particularly wrong with it.	game/ch_ben.rpy	45
ben_ask_kald_govt_dd3fb3f1	ben	Is that along the lines of what you were looking for?	game/ch_ben.rpy	47
ben_ask_kald_govt_f7fd1beb	p	Yes, thank you.	game/ch_ben.rpy	51
ben_ask_kald_govt_ff4abd7e	p	Well, to be honest, I was looking for something more... in depth.	game/ch_ben.rpy	56
ben_ask_kald_govt_352ed468	ben	Ahh, I see.	game/ch_ben.rpy	58
ben_ask_kald_govt_e2032147	ben	Well, [alias.first], as I'm sure you understand, someone in a position such as mine must be very careful with what he says and to whom he says it.	game/ch_ben.rpy	61
ben_ask_kald_govt_3201cffe	ben	Especially in such tense times such as these.	game/ch_ben.rpy	64
ben_ask_kald_govt_a8bac1ac	ben	Now, as you seem to have already figured out, my opinion on how the kaldreans govern themselves is not exactly positive.	game/ch_ben.rpy	67
ben_ask_kald_govt_91ee3620	ben	I would gladly talk about it with someone whom I knew I could trust.	game/ch_ben.rpy	69
ben_ask_kald_govt_03741fec	ben	On the other hand, you have shown yourself to be a reliable and competent person.	game/ch_ben.rpy	77
ben_ask_kald_govt_923befe9	ben	Maybe I could share with you some of my less... popular opinions on the kaldrean governmental system.	game/ch_ben.rpy	79
ben_ask_kald_govt_dcedc3b2	p	I'm listening.	game/ch_ben.rpy	81
ben_ask_kald_govt_32351836	ben	The kaldrean government on Qolisk is a tad... shall we say, controlling. Have you read 
Vel Kerriss' Dystopia?	game/ch_ben.rpy	83
ben_ask_kald_govt_3ffde9df	p	I can't say that I have.	game/ch_ben.rpy	85
ben_ask_kald_govt_8b439213	ben	It was a controversial kaldrean novel that made it past the government's censors and was widely read and lauded as one of the greatest works of literature to date.	game/ch_ben.rpy	87
ben_ask_kald_govt_1e6995ea	ben	It may remind you of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.	game/ch_ben.rpy	89
ben_ask_kald_govt_7d317f47	ben	Simply put: their government is controlling, [alias.first], but what they take away from their people they seem to give back in other ways.	game/ch_ben.rpy	91
ben_ask_kald_govt_d85eb06a	ben	They have the highest standards of living I have ever seen, crime rates are low, there are no apparent problems.	game/ch_ben.rpy	94
ben_ask_kald_govt_5e23a77c	p	But they are blissfully ignorant.	game/ch_ben.rpy	96
ben_ask_kald_govt_842a886c	ben	You could say that, yes. I think that about covers their situation without inordinately distorting the truth.	game/ch_ben.rpy	98
ben_ask_day_c947206d	p	How has your day been, Ambassador?	game/ch_ben.rpy	106
ben_ask_day_04280197	ben	Quite frustrating, actually.	game/ch_ben.rpy	108
ben_ask_day_5fdf6ab7	p	May I ask why?	game/ch_ben.rpy	110
ben_ask_day_12465b98	ben	Well, I urgently need to speak with Lida Ezekeri Skar, the kaldrean Senior Operations manager, but she has been actively avoiding all my attempts to meet with her.	game/ch_ben.rpy	112
ben_ask_day_3cdae9fa	p	Any reason why you think she has been avoiding you? Or why she can in the first place?	game/ch_ben.rpy	115
ben_ask_day_4b8aa2c3	ben	As a kaldrean she is only obligated to respond to meeting requests with other kaldreans. On top of that, Ms. Ezekeri is an older woman who is set in her says, and has a certain... distaste for human politicians such as myself.	game/ch_ben.rpy	117
ben_ask_day_dad47c6f	p	Well, that is quite unfortunate.	game/ch_ben.rpy	123
ben_ask_day_eaa50289	p	Is it possible she would be more willing to listen to a newcomer such as myself?	game/ch_ben.rpy	129
ben_ask_day_37e2a886	ben	Hmmm... what a novel idea. Yes, why don't you try to persuade her? I would be most appreciative of the favor.	game/ch_ben.rpy	131
ben_ask_day_4866b7ff	ben	Now that I think of it, I'm confident you'll be able to persuade her to meet with me. You'll find Ms. Ezekeri in the kaldrean embassy.	game/ch_ben.rpy	133
ben_ask_day_6f37d73d	ben	Tell her that I need to discuss the new trade regulations with her.	game/ch_ben.rpy	135
ben_ask_day_5a0aceaa	p	Of course, but why exactly are you so confident in me? You only met me a few minutes ago.	game/ch_ben.rpy	137
ben_ask_day_b3247489	ben	I can just tell that you are going to have an impact here - perhaps you don't recognize it yet.	game/ch_ben.rpy	139
ben_ask_day_208e3a6b	p	I'll take your word for it.	game/ch_ben.rpy	141
ben_mention_lida_ffd902de	ben	Have you spoken to Ms. Ezekeri in the Kaldrean Embassy yet?	game/ch_ben.rpy	148
ben_mention_lida_94276cc7	p	Sorry, I haven't done that yet.	game/ch_ben.rpy	152
ben_mention_lida_8a4bbbb8	ben	Take your time. I will be awaiting news of your success.	game/ch_ben.rpy	154
ben_mention_lida_652477f1	p	I did talk to her but...	game/ch_ben.rpy	158
ben_mention_lida_e5c62126	ben	Let me guess: she was too difficult.	game/ch_ben.rpy	160
ben_mention_lida_eba8ea2a	p	Unfortunately, yes.	game/ch_ben.rpy	162
ben_mention_lida_43ce8161	p	I did, and she has decided to meet with you.	game/ch_ben.rpy	170
ben_mention_lida_4501a1a6	ben	That is wonderful news! I knew that you could pull this off, [alias.first].	game/ch_ben.rpy	172
ben_mention_lida_dfbd0248	ben	Ah yes, she has sent me a message accepting my latest request.	game/ch_ben.rpy	174
ben_mention_lida_206e3c9b	ben	Thank you very much for your help, [alias.first]. I will remember your kindness.	game/ch_ben.rpy	176
ben_advice_64519f71	p	What advice can you offer, from one diplomat to another?	game/ch_ben.rpy	184
ben_advice_a2cb0321	ben	Ah yes, of course. What often happens to the greenhorns who arrive here from Earth and Qolisk alike, is that they forget that they are entering an entirely new environment.	game/ch_ben.rpy	186
ben_advice_1b2ffd02	ben	You have to drop your prejudices and fabrications and simply observe. If you can't, then you struggle.	game/ch_ben.rpy	189
ben_advice_2e8341d3	p	I respect your advice, Ambassador –	game/ch_ben.rpy	191
ben_advice_b5209178	ben	Call me Ben, please	game/ch_ben.rpy	193
ben_advice_68fc0775	p	I respect your advice, Ben, but doesn't it seem like a lot to ask of anyone to simply "drop their prejudices?"	game/ch_ben.rpy	195
ben_advice_a5f5452b	ben	Of course it is. It's completely unreasonable – everyone will remain with their judgment tailored by their experiences.	game/ch_ben.rpy	197
ben_advice_fd6b14a7	ben	I never claimed it was possible simply become judgment-free. That does not mean that you can't try.	game/ch_ben.rpy	200
ben_advice_2a9ab253	ben	The closer you come to being spotless, the more those around you will accept you.	game/ch_ben.rpy	202
ben_advice_9e9ec633	ben	If only...	game/ch_ben.rpy	204
ben_advice_1b640dae	p	What?	game/ch_ben.rpy	206
ben_events_c863762f	p	You probably know all about the rumors of racial tensions that have been circulating. Care to elaborate?	game/ch_ben.rpy	212
ben_events_e1cb0e7d	ben	Rumors are but rumors - they are innocuous little flies that eventually die down. No need to concern yourself with these "rumors" my friend.	game/ch_ben.rpy	214
ben_events_be7f0db3	ben	I can assure that both Ambassador Irridiss and I are on quite even terms.	game/ch_ben.rpy	216
ben_events_232feae2	ben	The peace that we maintain here is secure so there is really no need to worry.	game/ch_ben.rpy	218
ben_events_e02f1060	p	If you insist...	game/ch_ben.rpy	220
ben_events_d672a5f2	ben	I have no reason to be dishonest with you.	game/ch_ben.rpy	222
ben_events_058ac1d4	p	No, I believe you. Thank you for the reassurance, Ben.	game/ch_ben.rpy	224
ben_Bg_98b003cf	p	Tell me about yourself	game/ch_ben.rpy	230
ben_Bg_87d7d5d8	ben	There is not much to tell. I was born and raised here in this beautiful city and grew up inspired by the previous human and kaldrean ambassadors.	game/ch_ben.rpy	232
ben_Bg_92cb6a44	ben	After graduate school I went into politics and I suppose you know how that turned out.	game/ch_ben.rpy	234
ch_cole_46b6734f	cole	Welcome to my store. What are you looking for today?	game/ch_cole.rpy	13
ch_cole_123119d0	p	Actually, I just arrived here, so I'm still adjusting to the climate and getting to know people. I'm [alias.full]. Nice to meet you.	game/ch_cole.rpy	14
menu_cole_a6566c0f	cole	[last_dialog]	game/ch_cole.rpy	19
cole_advice_81cd3214	p	Do you have any advice for a citizen new to Concord?	game/ch_cole.rpy	33
cole_advice_5459b051	cole	Give me a moment.	game/ch_cole.rpy	34
cole_advice_8c28288f	cole	Alright, I'm going to try to keep this concise, because no one likes a rambler.	game/ch_cole.rpy	35
cole_advice_ae174290	cole	Make friends here and give them your trust. Trust is a "give first and receive later" game, so you have to be the one to stick out your neck and offer it.	game/ch_cole.rpy	36
cole_advice_1260be55	p	And what happens if they betray you?	game/ch_cole.rpy	38
cole_advice_ec484bc6	cole	C'mon now, I never said you just walk around with your head down and your hands at your sides. You aren't asking them marry you. You just have to make some concessions in order to gain something out of an acquaintance. Test the waters before you leap in head-first.	game/ch_cole.rpy	39
cole_advice_639db9af	p	I can understand that. Thank you, Mr. Demarc.	game/ch_cole.rpy	42
cole_advice_16c606e1	cole	It's just Cole.	game/ch_cole.rpy	43
cole_advice_67681e0c	p	Right; thanks, Cole.	game/ch_cole.rpy	44
cole_events_cfb7ca69	p	So I've heard rumors of tensions between the kaldreans and humans here, what do you think is going on?	game/ch_cole.rpy	49
cole_events_cc4e46b4	cole	Rumors don't speak loudly, son, and in my older age I do not have the best of hearing any more. So I can't say that I've heard much...	game/ch_cole.rpy	50
cole_events_5238d24c	cole	Well, actually I have heard some rather harsh things about Irridiss lately.	game/ch_cole.rpy	53
cole_events_5f53e3b1	cole	I don't really know what to make of it, but I don't think I'm in much of a place to do anything about it, to be honest	game/ch_cole.rpy	54
cole_events_692e4dd1	cole	Why would you ask such a question, just out of curiosity?	game/ch_cole.rpy	56
cole_events_35ae79c0	p	Oh, just getting a feel for the community is all. Rumors make me uneasy, and I do not like being out of the know.	game/ch_cole.rpy	57
cole_events_aa6620bc	cole	Okay then, [alias.title_last]. Anything else I can help you with today?	game/ch_cole.rpy	58
cole_Bg_tree_start_3e361c29	p	So what can you tell me about your past? You seem like you are full of rich stories.	game/ch_cole.rpy	62
cole_Bg_tree_start_d2f05fdb	cole	I'd prefer not to talk about the past - it's not really something I like to share, and I do not want anyone's pity.	game/ch_cole.rpy	63
cole_Bg_tree_start_041968a4	p	Everything alright, Cole?	game/ch_cole.rpy	65
cole_Bg_tree_start_602b0efa	cole	Yes. I'm fine.	game/ch_cole.rpy	66
cole_Bg_tree_pursue_3164fd48	p	Well, is there anything else you can tell me about the history of this planet? When you got here or what it was like being exposed to the kaldreans for the first time?	game/ch_cole.rpy	74
cole_Bg_tree_apologize_3741c02a	p	I apologize, I didn't realize that it was a delicate topic for you.	game/ch_cole.rpy	81
cole_Bg_tree_apologize_c3d1cbe4	cole	It's okay, I didn't mean to snap at you. Things weren't always as easy for us as kids. Even less so during the contact conflict.	game/ch_cole.rpy	83
cole_Bg_tree_apologize_36fd326d	cole	As my great granddad would say, "Walking to the Academy was uphill, both ways!" Oh, how he cracked me up. Never thought it would stick with me for all these years.	game/ch_cole.rpy	84
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_bb5668d5	p	Well, if you ever have anything you want to share with me, you have my complete confidentiality. I'd be happy to listen.	game/ch_cole.rpy	92
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_f125e71d	cole	Well, you seem like a well-mannered kid. Here's a little about Old Cole.	game/ch_cole.rpy	94
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_93606775	cole	I was part of Operation Bridge, on the TSS Destroyer Verdict. I was the Gunnery Officer on board. It was that operation we made first contact with the kaldreans, actually.	game/ch_cole.rpy	96
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_a164a987	cole	Then the fighting began... I lost some of my closest friends that day. A lost some of myself as I watched the Verdict lose its battle with gravity and fell to Bridge.	game/ch_cole.rpy	99
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_621b4663	cole	It was a fight no one wanted, but it was a fight nonetheless. I was unable to forgive the kaldreans for many years.	game/ch_cole.rpy	101
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_3612c34a	cole	Eventually it became evident that we had both wronged one another, and that it was time I moved on. It was difficult, but I'm past it now.	game/ch_cole.rpy	103
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_7e909e69	cole	Took my mind off things by applying myself to electronics. Turns out I have a penchant for it. After Uncle Klay opened up his place I was second.	game/ch_cole.rpy	105
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_36a3ef54	cole	I faced the problem head on, and I'm a better person now because of it. Remember not to turn away from your fears, because they will still be there.	game/ch_cole.rpy	107
cole_Bg_tree_confidentiality_19c58c3a	p	Right. Well thank you very much for sharing on such a fragile topic.	game/ch_cole.rpy	108
ch_jon_ae12121a	jon	Was I not clear? Don't talk to me, [alias.last], unless you find spending time in confinement appealing.	game/ch_jon.rpy	11
ch_jon_f638de8d	jon	[last_dialog]	game/ch_jon.rpy	17
ch_jon_bdfcd683	jon	Give me a moment here...	game/ch_jon.rpy	20
ch_jon_6e625b25	jon	HEY! JANS! GET YOUR PEOPLE ON THE TARMAC ASAP.	game/ch_jon.rpy	21
ch_jon_d16f41da	jon	Sorry. Can I help you [alias.address]?	game/ch_jon.rpy	22
ch_jon_b7dfc43d	p	I'm just trying to get to know people here.	game/ch_jon.rpy	24
ch_jon_a6c0c1c5	jon	New to Concord? Welcome. I'm Jonathan Caise, manager of logistics here at the port.	game/ch_jon.rpy	26
ch_jon_0c9ba35b	p	[alias.full], diplomat over at the Human Embassy.	game/ch_jon.rpy	28
ch_jon_84d66abd	jon	Greenhorn diplomat? Make sure you really take your time to get to know people.	game/ch_jon.rpy	30
ch_jon_6abd14dd	jon	I've seen my fair share of rookies bail and out and leave because Concord is too much a culture shock for them. But you look like you've got a good head on your shoulders.	game/ch_jon.rpy	31
ch_jon_f3ffca18	p	I'm determined to leave my footprint here.	game/ch_jon.rpy	34
menu_jon_b8748030	jon	[last_dialog]	game/ch_jon.rpy	41
jon_advice_efd66584	p	Do you have any advice for a newcomer like me?	game/ch_jon.rpy	63
jon_advice_7f0e078a	jon	Hmmm... I want to say something philosophical but nothing is really coming to me.	game/ch_jon.rpy	65
jon_advice_d3f60b07	jon	Basically, if you want to successfully build friendships here, do your research. If you know someone's culture more likely than not you're going to find it simpler to talk to them.	game/ch_jon.rpy	67
jon_advice_cb99aa67	p	And how would I go about this "research?"	game/ch_jon.rpy	70
jon_advice_9e6eb555	jon	I'm not going to pretend that history and culture is everyone's cup of "vaska." But for me, it's the fascination with it that makes me want to learn more.	game/ch_jon.rpy	72
jon_advice_94d65f6d	jon	The more you genuinely want to find something out, the more you remember along the way and the more likely you are to recall it later... usually when you need it most.	game/ch_jon.rpy	75
jon_advice_03aa0185	p	"Vaska?"	game/ch_jon.rpy	77
jon_advice_db72c27f	jon	Oh, sorry... kaldrean beverage that's like tea on Earth. Tea doesn't grow here, so we had to find some kind of substitute. Alkay's place, Oasis, has some of the best in the city.	game/ch_jon.rpy	79
jon_advice_17ef512d	jon	In general Alkay's a good guy to know. If you want some REAL advice, talk to him.	game/ch_jon.rpy	81
jon_advice_08cce9bc	p	I'll be sure to check it out. And thank you for your help.	game/ch_jon.rpy	83
jon_events_353dfeb7	p	Have you heard the talk about mounting racial tensions?	game/ch_jon.rpy	89
jon_events_97cca8c5	jon	It is just talk, but I have.	game/ch_jon.rpy	91
jon_events_f6f1199d	p	What do you think about them?	game/ch_jon.rpy	93
jon_events_1119ec43	jon	I don't really. You really just have to put that kind of stuff aside and focus on the task at hand. If I'm preoccupied then I start to make errors in my work.	game/ch_jon.rpy	95
jon_events_be9814c2	jon	And errors in my field of work are unacceptable.	game/ch_jon.rpy	97
jon_events_164aa94f	jon	Since I do not have much time outside of my work anyway, I just try to make the most of it. I can't really do that if I'm constantly worried about innocuous small talk.	game/ch_jon.rpy	99
jon_events_49947b95	p	Right, I can certainly agree. Thank you for giving me a moment.	game/ch_jon.rpy	101
jon_background_5a5c782f	p	Could you tell me about your background?	game/ch_jon.rpy	108
jon_background_08521c78	jon	I'm not really an interesting person, greenhorn. I was born and raised here on Concord - I visited Earth for a few years when I was eighteen then came back.	game/ch_jon.rpy	110
jon_background_ec61b788	jon	I have a pretty good memory and eye for detail so I was sought-after for this kind of number work. It's pretty repetitive, but I'll take it as long as it pays me well.	game/ch_jon.rpy	112
jon_background_e2736da5	jon	I am a little obsessed with history and cultures - and especially through the lens of weaponry. In my spare time I collect vintage firearms and restore them.	game/ch_jon.rpy	114
jon_background_05bb4b52	p	That sounds quite interesting actually.	game/ch_jon.rpy	116
jon_background_cf8f0e8a	jon	It's fascinating. If you find me outside of work I'm most likely researching a weapon, repairing it, or maintaining it.	game/ch_jon.rpy	118
jon_background_c9bc4a63	p	And you said you weren't an interesting person...	game/ch_jon.rpy	120
jon_background_68c3bf1d	jon	Well... not everyone is enthralled by tales of firearms and how they reflect a people's culture and history. So I tend to leave it out of conversation unless explicitly asked.	game/ch_jon.rpy	122
jon_hobbies_tree_start_61a6c4c4	p	I myself am super into collecting cultural relics.	game/ch_jon.rpy	130
jon_hobbies_tree_start_97965f24	jon	You too? I'm into that sort of thing, only I specifically focus on firearms. They fascinate me, especially the older ones.	game/ch_jon.rpy	132
jon_hobbies_tree_start_8ed10838	jon	None of this new-aged single moving part linear motor type stuff - but the real-deal, mechanically operated weapons from the later 20th and early 21st centuries.	game/ch_jon.rpy	134
jon_hobbies_tree_start_8c7c6150	p	I have picked up a few of those myself, nothing too special though.	game/ch_jon.rpy	136
jon_hobbies_tree_start_09833fc4	jon	Really, what models?	game/ch_jon.rpy	138
jon_hobbies_tree_start_64152fdf	p	Hm... I am still having them identified, but I know one is an ACR.	game/ch_jon.rpy	140
jon_hobbies_tree_start_89b7cd9e	jon	What a catch! That is a fine piece of machinery. If you haven't searched around for it's service history and stats then I suggest you do.	game/ch_jon.rpy	142
jon_hobbies_tree_start_3e147b71	jon	It's always the history and cultural aspects that interest me the most. The more you have looked into a people's culture and history the more you can understand them.	game/ch_jon.rpy	144
jon_hobbies_tree_start_42688030	p	I take it you have also closely studied the kaldrean weapons as well?	game/ch_jon.rpy	146
jon_hobbies_tree_start_bd6e3fbe	jon	Oh yes. Theirs are some of the finest I've ever seen. I wish I could find more on their inventors and histories, but the kaldrean government makes that nearly impossible.	game/ch_jon.rpy	148
jon_hobbies_tree_start_5a3960af	p	And why is that?	game/ch_jon.rpy	150
jon_hobbies_tree_start_b8748030	jon	[last_dialog]	game/ch_jon.rpy	154
jon_hobbies_tree_start_f638de8d	jon	[last_dialog]	game/ch_jon.rpy	161
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_895c5f24	p	Why do they do this to their people? That seems pretty harsh.	game/ch_jon.rpy	165
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_f6946cf8	jon	Aren't you supposed to know this, greenhorn? Well... I'm in upper management and they don't tell us anything either. I'll make it easy for you.	game/ch_jon.rpy	167
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_911e255b	jon	Their government is perfect - a little too perfect if you know what I mean. Really they are so corrupt that they can afford to maintain that kind of image.	game/ch_jon.rpy	169
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_dc2bfa25	jon	Incidentally it's causing cultural stagnation on a scale the likes of which humanity has never experienced.	game/ch_jon.rpy	171
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_4ebc5754	jon	I hope that the progressive movement on Qolisk does something fast, because if they don't then the kaldreans are at risk of deteriorating.	game/ch_jon.rpy	173
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_0720609c	jon	The way the government takes cultural movements and crushes them truly makes me sick - it's the slowest and most painful way for a people to die.	game/ch_jon.rpy	175
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_65395c8b	p	I'm genuinely shocked. I'll try to do something about this, but I've talked with the Ambassadors - it could prove challenging.	game/ch_jon.rpy	177
jon_hobbies_tree_pursue_aeddddc8	jon	Don't expect to get very far. But it's good to know that at least someone else around here recognizes that there is a problem at all.	game/ch_jon.rpy	179
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_0a68375b	p	Do you think Valak Lideri are politically charged against the government?	game/ch_jon.rpy	186
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_9486cc4f	jon	That could be said about any rebel group. But yes. Currently it makes sense for an organization like that to start gaining political traction.	game/ch_jon.rpy	188
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_a78681dd	p	But they aren't terrorists.	game/ch_jon.rpy	190
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_75f39b8d	jon	Right. From what I've heard, and likely what you've heard as well, they are becoming a threat as a political influence rather than a violent group.	game/ch_jon.rpy	192
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_d1305c38	jon	Based on what little I know, I believe that have a good cause - they want to give the kaldrean progressive movement new life and new force.	game/ch_jon.rpy	194
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_ab7221bb	jon	Many kaldreans want to be free of their suppressive controllers - Valak Lideri are not afraid to do what is right.	game/ch_jon.rpy	196
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_thank_jon_3652da0a	p	Thank you for the information, Jon.	game/ch_jon.rpy	206
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_thank_jon_4dc71fe6	jon	Yeah, well... No problem.	game/ch_jon.rpy	207
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_liberation_db61cced	p	I do not want to see the kaldrean people end in a slow deterioration. I think that the kaldrean people deserve liberation from their fate.	game/ch_jon.rpy	214
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_liberation_07312eb8	jon	That's good news. We could use more diplomats who share your our viewpoints working to bring the corruption to justice.	game/ch_jon.rpy	216
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_liberation_027f5506	jon	Valak Lideri might be the only way that change will ever happen. No offense, greenhorn, but if I've learned anything working here, it's that politicians will not sway.	game/ch_jon.rpy	218
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_passionate_365b33ea	p	You seem quite passionate about this topic.	game/ch_jon.rpy	225
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_passionate_a54dad6d	jon	Well... I am, of course. Outside of my work I am very interested in history and culture so it pains me to see one so rich ruined like this.	game/ch_jon.rpy	227
jon_hobbies_tree_VL_passionate_40540460	jon	And... from what I've heard, Valak Lideri are trying to stop the kaldrean government from destroying their people. I can't help but find their perspective... agreeable	game/ch_jon.rpy	229
jon_VL_tree_start_88fac75a	p	What can you tell me about Valak Lideri?	game/ch_jon.rpy	236
jon_VL_tree_start_ba6921be	jon	I don't really have much to say about them other than they make me nervous and distract me from my work. So I don't like to think about them.	game/ch_jon.rpy	238
jon_VL_tree_start_0c5d6cde	jon	I wish I could tell you more... but I can't.	game/ch_jon.rpy	239
jon_VL_tree_uneasy_25957c01	p	Is there something wrong? You seem a little... uneasy.	game/ch_jon.rpy	247
jon_VL_tree_uneasy_94654c1e	jon	I feel like you are trying to accuse me of something when you barely know me or anything about who I am. So yes, it makes me very uneasy.	game/ch_jon.rpy	248
jon_VL_tree_uneasy_b481a463	jon	And I already told you that I do not want to speak about Valak Lideri.	game/ch_jon.rpy	250
jon_VL_tree_uneasy_106e6e21	jon	Threats like that are better handled by professional agents rather than operational and civil agents like you and I.	game/ch_jon.rpy	252
jon_VL_tree_uneasy_47cdbd1e	p	I apologize. I didn't mean to upset you.	game/ch_jon.rpy	254
jon_VL_tree_go_along_5b733eee	p	Right, well I'll just have to dig around some more. 	game/ch_jon.rpy	261
jon_VL_tree_go_along_e9beda8d	jon	Perhaps you might talk to Flight Commander Zalva. She's younger, but she's seen a lot. She's a little... cold, but oddly friendly.	game/ch_jon.rpy	262
jon_accuse_c389330c	p	You know what, Jon, you haven't done a very good job covering up the fact that you are part of Valak Lideri.	game/ch_jon.rpy	268
jon_accuse_da0f41dc	jon	That is a very serious accusation - I don't take any accusations lightly. So get out of my face before I remove you myself.	game/ch_jon.rpy	269
jon_VL_plan_tree_start_e924fbad	p	I know it makes you uncomfortable to talk about Valak Lideri, but I want you to know what I agree with their perspective.	game/ch_jon.rpy	275
jon_VL_plan_tree_start_94fd99d7	jon	Don't make an accusation that you have no basis for, [alias.last]. I don't want to have to charge you for treasonous activity.	game/ch_jon.rpy	276
jon_VL_plan_tree_bluff_1f7cfa20	p	I'm aware of Valak Lideri's plans, Jon.	game/ch_jon.rpy	286
jon_VL_plan_tree_bluff_b58de74e	jon	Hah! You're pulling my leg here. Of the two of us, you are exhibiting exactly the kind of dangerous behavior that Valak Lideri would expect.	game/ch_jon.rpy	287
jon_VL_plan_tree_bluff_191f5879	jon	If you keep talking to me I'll have you removed from this area. Be glad that I'm only sending you off with a warning, [alias.last].	game/ch_jon.rpy	289
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_88a803d9	p	Listen to me, Jon, I will not stand here and allow the kaldrean government to continue breaking down their own people or the human government to sit idly and let it happen.	game/ch_jon.rpy	295
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_77d0bdc9	jon	You're walking on thin ice, greenhorn, but I agree with you. So answer me this: how far you would go to see this change through?	game/ch_jon.rpy	296
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_violence_0ac88a93	p	If we want to accomplish anything, we have to enforce it. Violence may not be the best strategic answer, but long-term effects do not spark revolutions.	game/ch_jon.rpy	306
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_violence_fda86298	p	A bullet can both literally and figuratively create the spark that ignites a change.	game/ch_jon.rpy	308
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_violence_1cd7188b	jon	I can see why you would think that. But you need to understand that the long-term solutions have lasted longer in retrospect.	game/ch_jon.rpy	310
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_violence_f71cd30b	jon	Still, I agree that violence compliments peace in such a delicate balance that it's often broken. Because once you've started the fire, you have to put it out.	game/ch_jon.rpy	312
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_violence_58ec3f62	jon	A well-placed bullet can mean the difference between chaotic disaster and effective victory - but at the same time, a well-timed armistice can decide the fate of a people.	game/ch_jon.rpy	314
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_what_39f58a65	p	We have to focus on "what" we are trying to change more than "how". It's the "what" which gives us direction.	game/ch_jon.rpy	321
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_what_889f8018	p	If we lose sight of what we are fighting to change, then it simply turns into a brawl. Once the goal has been achieved, there is no longer a reason to fight for it.	game/ch_jon.rpy	323
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_what_25219b3b	jon	Of course... because holding grudges against your enemies after a war is concluded has only ever proven counterproductive.	game/ch_jon.rpy	325
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_what_ebb2571e	jon	I agree with you, [alias.first], you make a strong point.	game/ch_jon.rpy	327
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_what_8729f2d4	p	I can't stress it enough. There is simply no need to fight another lengthy war when one isn't necessary or even logical.	game/ch_jon.rpy	329
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_e982ff24	p	We have to remember, though, that while violence may be able to trip off a revolution, it will not end it with a stable resolution.	game/ch_jon.rpy	336
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_1e60e90e	p	Violence does nothing but alienate people who forget what they are fighting for. They seem only to remember that they must kill their enemies.	game/ch_jon.rpy	338
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_c8810e36	p	It may be powerful, but chaos ultimately creates more chaos. It's simply how the universe works as a closed system.	game/ch_jon.rpy	340
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_35b6dad6	jon	But you have to remember, that while peace may be powerful and orderly, it does not come quickly. You may offend just as many people if you don't fight.	game/ch_jon.rpy	342
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_1e5f03a6	jon	Kaldreans especially - they'll lose respect for a force that attempts to avoid battle.	game/ch_jon.rpy	344
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_40af6ed5	p	Unfortunately. But it's a small price to pay when you are going to drastically alter the course of a people's future.	game/ch_jon.rpy	346
jon_VL_plan_tree_change_peace_fafa608b	jon	I suppose. But you'll really have to do some sweet-talking when you try to convince skeptical kaldreans of this.	game/ch_jon.rpy	348
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_7a999305	p	I'm sure if you were to speak to Alkay, he would give his word that I am trustworthy.	game/ch_jon.rpy	355
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_ebe4a1da	p	He and I have already had this discussion so I know what you are going to do.	game/ch_jon.rpy	357
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_5d45c56e	jon	You're bluffing.	game/ch_jon.rpy	359
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_8f0b5981	p	Tomorrow morning is when everything is going to change - through the lens of a linear rifle scope.	game/ch_jon.rpy	361
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_a601044d	jon	And what are you going to do about it?	game/ch_jon.rpy	363
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_8ba63d12	p	I assure you that I'm only trying to help.	game/ch_jon.rpy	365
jon_VL_plan_tree_aware_edd14a99	jon	I still don't believe you, [alias.last], but I don't know how else you would have obtained that information. I'll humor you.	game/ch_jon.rpy	367
ch_lauren_dbfa0421	lauren	You must be the recent arrival. My director mentioned you. What was your name, [alias.last]? [alias.full]?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	12
ch_lauren_2ce132a4	p	You got it.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	13
ch_lauren_0f5f9622	lauren	I'm Lauren Gray, manager of logistics here.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	14
ch_lauren_b4fa0016	p	It's a pleasure to meet you.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	15
menu_lauren_692449ef	lauren	[last_dialog]	game/ch_lauren.rpy	20
lauren_background_c3941055	p	So what can you tell me about your past?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	36
lauren_background_173b0521	lauren	I don't really have time for this chit-chat right now.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	37
lauren_advice_1dc84298	p	Excuse me... sorry, but would you be willing to offer me any advice as I start my work here?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	42
lauren_advice_1c40105c	lauren	...	game/ch_lauren.rpy	43
lauren_advice_473ba6ef	p	Ms. Gray?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	44
lauren_advice_82334497	lauren	I heard you, I just don't really have anything to say.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	46
lauren_advice_30d15a84	lauren	Alright, I suppose I can offer a few words. I work with numbers all day long and I don't get out much so I'm probably not the best person to ask.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	47
lauren_advice_bf5caac8	lauren	But after working here for a while I've noticed a pattern, like a bell curve in a distribution graph – those who talk too much or too little are more or less shut away by society.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	48
lauren_advice_5f409947	p	Don't be too—	game/ch_lauren.rpy	51
lauren_advice_64fdea9c	lauren	I wasn't done talking. Those who know just when and what to say make it very far very fast. It doesn't matter what your race may be, it's the same for everyone.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	53
lauren_advice_aebec6a2	p	So— actually, thank you for your advice. I'll let you get back to your work.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	55
lauren_events_a84c334e	p	What is your opinion on this alleged racial tension within Concord?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	61
lauren_events_87747e71	lauren	Do you think that I am going to have a good answer for you?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	63
lauren_events_79657c8d	p	I had hoped.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	65
lauren_events_c6fc0f71	lauren	Hah! About all I can tell you is that it is silly. I know plenty of kaldreans, none of whom are bothered or riled up by any of this so-called "tension."	game/ch_lauren.rpy	67
lauren_events_989bcf50	lauren	I would almost think that you've been lied to about this, because honestly, I haven't noticed anything particularly out of the ordinary. And I work in upper-level management!	game/ch_lauren.rpy	69
lauren_events_036e59f4	p	Yeah, but upper-level management has pulled the wool over your eyes.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	71
lauren_events_345ed6a7	lauren	What was that?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	73
lauren_events_7abbaf5a	p	Don't worry about it. Thank you for your time. I'll let you get back to work.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	75
lauren_info_tree_start_30ff6388	p	I am quite into literature myself. Might I ask what you are reading?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	81
lauren_info_tree_start_a4c918e6	lauren	This is a novel by a progressive kaldrean author. It's called Through the Void.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	83
lauren_info_tree_progressives_70564c27	p	A progressive author? What is your opinion on these progressive kaldreans?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	91
lauren_info_tree_progressives_78f1a092	lauren	I do think that the progressive movement is beneficial to the kaldrean people. Their government is so corrupt that it is really time for a change.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	93
lauren_info_tree_progressives_12cfdadd	lauren	I don't approve of how their government treats their people. It has me both angry and sorry at once - one of the few things that can actually make me emotional.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	95
lauren_info_tree_progressives_fa8bf610	p	It must be worse than I've been told.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	97
lauren_info_tree_progressives_f7294613	lauren	They don't tell us anything.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	99
lauren_info_tree_progressives_90717bf6	p	Thank you for answering my question.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	101
lauren_info_tree_novel_a81a4ee2	p	That must be a recent novel, because I haven't heard of it. Can you tell me about it?	game/ch_lauren.rpy	107
lauren_info_tree_novel_9c605abd	lauren	It's not normally a genre I read, I prefer more philosophical works, but this was so highly recommended that I had to pick up a copy.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	109
lauren_info_tree_novel_ef64c153	lauren	It is based off a true story of a kaldrean and a human who entered into a relationship during the first contact conflict.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	111
lauren_info_tree_novel_ffd93c3b	lauren	It raises a lot of questions about what makes us human and what makes them kaldrean. The author smartly decided to focus on themes rather than details.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	113
lauren_info_tree_novel_878fc8e0	lauren	It reminds me of someone I grew up with - Nidaria. I imagine this novel does a pretty good job portraying her family's situation.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	114
lauren_info_tree_sympathize_2787cfb5	p	I feel sorry for those humans and kaldreans who have to face that kind of oppression. It seems like an unnecessary barrier.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	122
lauren_info_tree_sympathize_064c8e62	lauren	Lorisk would certainly know about that. She was always picked on at school by the kaldreans especially, who did not approve of her human mother and kaldrean father.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	124
lauren_info_tree_sympathize_0379b772	lauren	And on top of that she was adopted, which did not sit well with the humans. She really did not deserve that kind of treatment.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	126
lauren_info_tree_sympathize_f81e7e2a	p	I'm sorry to hear that.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	128
lauren_info_tree_disapproval_8e455196	p	I don't think that kaldreans and humans should have that kind of relationship.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	135
lauren_info_tree_disapproval_e73a5b2a	lauren	That's narrow-minded of you, [alias.title_full]. I honestly would not have expected that kind of response from you. Or at least you would have kept it to yourself.	game/ch_lauren.rpy	137
sarah_arrive_7166c7b6	sarah	Greetings. I'm Agent Redmont, but I prefer to stay in character whenever possible, so call me Sarah. I've heard that you're quite the sharp one.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	26
sarah_arrive_e9127ab2	p	If my record is anything to go by.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	29
sarah_arrive_58d3c8da	sarah	If your record can impress me, then you are definitely fit for this mission.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	31
sarah_arrive_baec3564	p	Diplomat? Ha! It should be a learning experience for all of us.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	33
sarah_arrive_70e30e3f	sarah	Before we're able to quell the political unrest, we need to understand it.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	35
sarah_arrive_fca57579	sarah	I've arranged it so that you now have access to the High Embassy, where you'll find High Ambassadors Ben Columbus and Vatrisk Irridiss Kier.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	37
sarah_arrive_dff1ea1a	sarah	I want you to go talk to them and learn about the state of the kaldrean government. They may not be very willing to divulge in-depth information, so speak carefully.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	40
sarah_kald_govt_info_1aaa5142	sarah	Have you talked to both Ambassadors yet?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	49
sarah_kald_govt_info_82e11d37	p	No, not yet.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	52
sarah_kald_govt_info_5c70c67e	sarah	Well, what are you waiting for? Come back when you have.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	53
sarah_kald_govt_info_02a893be	p	Yes, I have.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	56
sarah_kald_govt_info_418e45bc	sarah	And?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	58
sarah_kald_govt_info_7179aa43	p	I was able to get some useful information for Ambassador Columbus.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	61
sarah_kald_govt_info_ed275e24	p	Columbus told me that the kaldrean government is incredibly controlling.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	62
sarah_kald_govt_info_8ee0cb7e	p	That's why they don't seem to have any problems...	game/ch_sarah.rpy	64
sarah_kald_govt_info_6bcc19f2	sarah	Very interesting! And Irridiss?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	65
sarah_kald_govt_info_9ccabae7	p	Vatrisk said roughly the same thing as Columbus.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	67
sarah_kald_govt_info_982d63ea	sarah	Yes, this is very good to know. Excellent work, Agent.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	69
sarah_kald_govt_info_c86a091b	p	I didn't have the same luck with him... he wasn't willing to tell me anything of use.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	71
sarah_kald_govt_info_f05f0058	sarah	Hmmm, that is unfortunate. At least we have something, though.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	72
sarah_kald_govt_info_c82eb87f	p	Ambassador Columbus wasn't willing to give me any in-depth information, unfortunately.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	74
sarah_kald_govt_info_59eaacb8	sarah	Yes, that is very unfortunate. I assume you had better luck with Vatrisk, at least?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	75
sarah_kald_govt_info_fe72de4d	p	Yes, I did.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	77
sarah_kald_govt_info_f37f2580	sarah	Yes, this is very good to know. Good work.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	79
sarah_kald_govt_info_34ae3b12	p	Well... he wasn't very willing to divulge much information either.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	81
sarah_kald_govt_info_f3f69810	sarah	Dammit. I expected more of you, Agent. Oh well.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	82
sarah_kald_govt_info_1cec8c11	sarah	For your next task: As you know, there are rumors of Ambassador Irridiss' life being in danger. The assassination of such an important kaldrean figure would surely destabilize our already-fragile inter-racial relations.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	84
sarah_kald_govt_info_46d0d6ab	sarah	Unfortunately, Irridiss does not seem to be aware of these rumors, and if he is, he does not seem to be taking them seriously. He's been seen walking around the city, unguarded, as if there is nothing to fear. We must convince him otherwise.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	88
sarah_kald_govt_info_6d22c192	sarah	So, I want you to go around the city, and find out information about this mysterious rebel group that calls themselves Valak Lideri. Try to learn as much as you can about them, finding out whether or not this grave rumor is true.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	92
sarah_kald_govt_info_102ce956	sarah	When you've talked to several people and think you're ready, I'll set up an exclusive meeting between you and Ambassador Irridiss. By then, you'll hopefully have enough information to convince him to lay low until this threat has passed.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	96
sarah_kald_govt_info_babd741e	p	Sounds good.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	100
sarah_kald_govt_info_vatrisk_tell_804871fa	p	Vatrisk told me about how the main priority of their government is to keep the people safe.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	107
sarah_kald_govt_info_vatrisk_tell_c604943c	p	But to them that means sacrificing their happiness.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	109
sarah_vl_info_56e9ee15	sarah	Have you gathered enough information to talk to Ambassador Irridiss yet?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	113
sarah_vl_info_ce660bf7	sarah	Okay, I'll arrange for you to meet with him. Head to the High Embassy and ask to speak with him.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	116
sarah_vl_info_9dc57b54	p	Will do.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	118
sarah_vl_info_a60a9120	sarah	Okay.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	121
sarah_vatrisk_meet_179f05b2	sarah	Shouldn't you be meeting with Ambassador Irridiss?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	125
sarah_attack_just_happened_dcfefa4d	sarah	I heard what happened! Is Vatrisk alright? Is he safe?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	129
sarah_attack_just_happened_5118c8c4	p	Yes, the ambassador is fine. We have to find out who the Valak Lideri are and what they are going to do next before something like this happens again.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	131
sarah_attack_just_happened_a6c38fc0	sarah	Obviously! You go question people in the city and I'll go prepare a squad to take down the Valak Lideri.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	133
sarah_attack_just_happened_ccc841aa	sarah	Talk to me when you've figured out their plans.	game/ch_sarah.rpy	135
sarah_vl_plans_56688972	sarah	Have you found out who the rebels are or what their plan is?	game/ch_sarah.rpy	141

alkay_advice_ea027c8a	alkay	Certainly! In Vivarioss, or "Concord" as you know it, and indeed throughout of this wonderful planet there exists an entirely infant world - and she is still learning to crawl.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	58
alkay_advice_f920508e	alkay	I am an old man, and not to "toot my own horn" as you humans say, but I have seen my fair share of conflict, suffering, violence, camaraderie, hope, and strength to know a thing or two about living and breathing creatures.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	61
alkay_advice_c6b86d7a	alkay	We are all the same - over-simplified and cliché as it may sound.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	64
alkay_advice_71c4daad	alkay	But I have spent many, many years amongst my people, your people, and the entirely new people that live here on Bridge.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	66
alkay_advice_40e27c90	alkay	They are neither human, nor kaldrean - but something novel, unique, miraculous even.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	69
alkay_advice_e8b1a350	p	I'm not entirely sure I follow.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	71
alkay_advice_83814ccc	alkay	think of it like this: you are not the same person as your mother and father. You are separate and you are independent.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	73
alkay_advice_7613212a	alkay	They gave you life and they brought you up, but ultimately you shape yourself.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	75
alkay_advice_623edf6c	p	But I am still a human.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	77
alkay_advice_2a904ae7	alkay	Ah, but you see, we are still living beings. The people who live here may appear kaldrean or human, but they are a new people with a new culture.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	79
alkay_advice_6c70f675	alkay	You must be prepared to navigate this place with an open mind - and you must try. I cannot promise that my words will miraculously change you - that takes years.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	82
alkay_advice_0bbfcacf	alkay	I simply hope that I can provide you with an idea of what lies ahead.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	85
alkay_advice_93f8cc93	p	Of course. Thank you so much.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	87
alkay_events_66477423	p	Have you heard rumors of racial tension here on Concord.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	93
alkay_events_e102d31c	alkay	When you run a business where it is practically your job to know people, you certainly do have a chance to hear all the talk.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	95
alkay_events_984d38b4	alkay	So yes, I have heard about this "tension," as you refer to it.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	97
alkay_events_80461416	alkay	However, I think that the terminology is all wrong - "tension" comes across so poorly that people are afraid to speak about it... so I commend you [alias.first] for your bravery to broach the subject.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	99
alkay_events_bec7c323	alkay	But this is no ordinary "tension."	game/ck_alkay.rpy	102
alkay_events_c28a51e2	p	You're going to have to elaborate, how do you mean this is not simply tension? What more do you think this is?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	104
alkay_events_27238a36	alkay	Its a change. I remember back when our first dark-energy craft were created, how you could smell the ozone and the distinct scent of dark-energy in the atmosphere.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	106
alkay_events_6440735b	alkay	You could feel the drives buzzing like beetles inside your very bones. The energy became a volume that you were suddenly within.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	108
alkay_events_78aecf9e	alkay	You can feel that energy here - it is not "tension" because that implies that things are pulling apart, but it is union, when you can sense them becoming closer.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	111
alkay_events_73a0f9ea	p	Are you always this well-spoken?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	114
alkay_events_fabac03e	alkay	Ha! I have had many years to develop that talent. But, I find that I can only really let loose when it is something that I am passionate for.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	116
alkay_events_092aa6d9	p	So you're passionate about whatever this "union" is that you referred to.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	118
alkay_events_87152e88	alkay	Definitely. I think that we, as separate races, are about to recognize a fundamental similarity and overcome a great deal of the separation we've self-imposed.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	120

alkay_adam_tree_start_8511a5b3	alkay	I still have regrets about... nevermind. If our military had been more organized at the time we could have avoided a great deal of the pain inflicted upon both sides	game/ck_alkay.rpy	145
alkay_adam_tree_start_0dba841b	alkay	I fear for the kaldrean people often, especially when I see the triumphs of humanity's democratic unions. The thought of Qolisk's controllers grinds my plating.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	148
alkay_adam_tree_start_91a68aec	alkay	[last_dialog]	game/ck_alkay.rpy	152
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_d646aed9	p	You seem quite bitter when you refer to Qolisk's government. Why exactly is that?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	160
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_a9436c06	alkay	Bitter... me? You do not know the half of it. During the conflict the government was difficult to say the least.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	162
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_0f511560	alkay	Had I not stepped in when and where I did the conflict would not have ended as it did, and the chances of alliance would be virtually nonexistent.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	164
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_91a68aec	alkay	[last_dialog]	game/ck_alkay.rpy	168
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_5e7a2858	p	Do you think that Valak Lideri share a similar viewpoint?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	176
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_c939fbdf	alkay	That was an awfully rapid change of subject there, [alias.first].	game/ck_alkay.rpy	178
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_060dd564	p	I'm just trying to get a better idea. From what I've heard Valak Lideri are a threat - so naturally that has me asking questions.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	180
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_aedf17aa	alkay	I understand. Everyone calls Valak Lideri a threat and a group of dangerous terrorists with terrorist intent.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	182
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_822a1c34	alkay	While this may have some basis in reality I feel we are misrepresenting them. Like most rebellious groups they have a cause and they are willing to fight for it.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	184
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_9a2cd317	alkay	Although, the manner with which they desire to accomplish their goals is questionable. But sometimes, we have to make concessions to serve a greater purpose.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	186
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_VL_3d6ddce7	p	Right. If we didn't then there wouldn't be any progress. Thank you for answering my questions Alkay.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	188
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_change_5416f7b3	p	Do you think things are about to change?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	194
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_change_461a9726	alkay	I know what you mean, despite how general that question was. Yes, change is inevitable - great change. When Concord was Constructed they literally had to move mountains.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	196
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_change_c7258a29	alkay	This place is capable of what can only be called miracles - when that kind of power is condensed into a single point, there is no stopping its impetus.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	199
alkay_adam_tree_bitterness_change_3a322c8e	p	With conviction like that you should probably be doing my job.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	202
alkay_adam_tree_hopefulness_8cb7689e	p	You think the future is bright? That is quite the opposite from what I've heard.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	208
alkay_adam_tree_hopefulness_7d701197	alkay	I can feel the pressure building - I know I am not the only one who feels it either. You can sense it in the way that everyone carries themselves.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	210
alkay_adam_tree_hopefulness_824d7cce	alkay	They walk with increasing strength when the sun rises every morning. Their eyes have a new vitality and their voices carry just a little farther.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	213
alkay_adam_tree_hopefulness_6170da73	alkay	Soon enough, paradigms will shift and changes will sweep over all of us.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	215
alkay_adam_tree_hopefulness_b8f73936	p	Your conviction is inspiring. Thank you for your sincerity. It's not exactly easy to come by.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	217
alkay_VL_tree_start_8660a04e	p	Can you tell me about these "Valak Lideri?" I've heard about them but the lack of information makes me uneasy.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	223
alkay_VL_tree_start_f809cc30	alkay	Yes, well, I have heard of this group. But they are just shadows and whispers. I cannot really offer more than my opinions.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	224
alkay_VL_tree_translate_26e28f71	p	Well, perhaps you could tell me more about the name? I am curious to know what it means and possibly any social context.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	232
alkay_VL_tree_translate_159c7968	alkay	Of course. "Valak Lideri" is a very, very old phrase from centuries ago. It is a member of the now-deceased kalaras dialect. Perhaps it is like your Latin dialect.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	234
alkay_VL_tree_translate_7c6f0992	alkay	Literally translated it means "Sovereign Paradise," which is a reference to the settling and construction of Qolisk's capital, Citadel.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	237
alkay_VL_tree_translate_8b4cc978	alkay	Personally I find it quite strange that a rebel group should name themselves with such an obscure phrase.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	239
alkay_VL_tree_translate_84d58ae6	alkay	It does not fit within a modern context so it does not speak to most of the younger, and likely more rebellious crowd.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	241
alkay_VL_tree_translate_ab768c9a	p	Thank you for elaborating, Alkay.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	243
alkay_VL_tree_history_5a83d4f2	p	Could you explain some of the kaldrean history? What were some key turning points for the kaldrean people? I think knowing more about the past could put them into context.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	250
alkay_VL_tree_history_c90249e4	alkay	That is quite a broad-spectrum question, so I'll do my best to generate a concise answer.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	253
alkay_VL_tree_history_a7d249d6	alkay	Just around two and a half millennia ago, the largest nomadic group of kaldreans found the Sovereign Paradise, which is the largest fertile region on Qolisk.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	255
alkay_VL_tree_history_aeb399a3	alkay	It was their beacon of hope - the could finally settle in one place.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	257
alkay_VL_tree_history_447020c6	p	Like Mesopotamia.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	259
alkay_VL_tree_history_42c6a809	alkay	Yes, exactly.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	261
alkay_VL_tree_history_c48ab460	alkay	Following settlement, there was a sustained period of development through which multiple industrial revolutions occurred and many technological boundaries were broken.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	263
alkay_VL_tree_history_3a946039	alkay	Wars were waged, nations rose and fell, but eventually a unified government began to consolidate control.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	266
alkay_VL_tree_history_15dac9e9	alkay	They quickly spread their power and their control through industry and eventually created a planet-wide union.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	268
alkay_VL_tree_history_a736ea4c	alkay	They but blinders on their people and gave them comfortable access to resources to suppress chances of rebellion. The people became complacent.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	270
alkay_VL_tree_history_b094c572	alkay	Nothing much has changed since then - a few centuries with a stable, albeit corrupted government. The advent of first contact has started to change things, however.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	272
alkay_VL_tree_history_1967e39e	p	I see. So do you think that Valak Lideri want to overthrow the Qolisk's government?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	275
alkay_VL_tree_history_2dcdc89a	alkay	It is entirely possible. Although that level of ambition is quite absurd.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	277
alkay_VL_tree_history_90fe05a0	p	I agree. Thank you for talking with me, Alkay.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	279
alkay_Bg_tree_start_b4f448ba	p	So how did you get here Alkay? I can tell that there is more to you than just a humble restaurant owner.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	285
alkay_Bg_tree_start_8ce2c6d0	alkay	Then your perception is sharp, because I do have a rather... colorful history. I used to be a rather high-raking individual in the kaldrean military.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	287
alkay_Bg_tree_start_6f8ff773	alkay	Now don't go telling everyone about this but - I was the Superior Commandant of the KAU Forerunner Ardelisk: the flagship of our fleet.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	289
alkay_Bg_tree_start_65732444	alkay	My position was the culmination of a lifetime living in a poor family without a high social status. For my family I worked and stove to reach my ambitious goals.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	291
alkay_Bg_tree_start_b65be3b6	alkay	I was and still am the record holder for the youngest Superior Commandant this century.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	293
alkay_Bg_tree_start_da5f7b9f	p	What does that role entail?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	295
alkay_Bg_tree_start_fb803418	alkay	It is like your military's "general" rank.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	297
alkay_Bg_tree_start_17808e22	p	Got it. Sorry for interrupting.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	299
alkay_Bg_tree_start_bd7c09fa	alkay	Not at all. I would rather you listen and ask questions than check out and pay me no attention. So when the conflict began, none of us wanted to fight.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	301
alkay_Bg_tree_start_b8b2b80c	alkay	However, misunderstandings between us and within our own ranks resulted in a conflict we had desperately hoped to avoid. And corruption finds it way into everything...	game/ck_alkay.rpy	303
alkay_Bg_tree_start_1794671c	alkay	It opened my eyes to see just how infested our own military really was. I began to challenge direct orders in favor of protecting my people and yours.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	305
alkay_Bg_tree_start_f0782cf0	p	That's quite commendable.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	307
alkay_Bg_tree_start_8ea1c88e	alkay	Hah! Commendable? When you are brought up believing that disobedience is the greatest weakness you may possess it was nearly impossible to weigh my options.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	309
alkay_Bg_tree_start_2fd332fc	alkay	But I could see that times and paradigms were about to change. The men and women under my command supported me.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	311
alkay_Bg_tree_start_ed7957e1	alkay	Along with a great deal of help from some of your people like Elder Demeter, we were able to avert complete chaos.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	313
alkay_Bg_tree_start_833119fa	alkay	Promptly following my service to the military I resigned myself, and decided to become scarce. I wanted to leave behind the government that had lied to me.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	315
alkay_Bg_tree_start_675eac9a	alkay	I spent many, many years surviving by myself. As a result I have picked up some valuable skills and learned some quite valuable lessons.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	317
alkay_Bg_tree_start_a1b54fd9	p	I can tell. You can clearly read people.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	319
alkay_Bg_tree_start_f694ceaf	alkay	Yes. It is one of the skills I take pride in possessing. It is invaluable. I can see that you are learning as well.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	321
alkay_Bg_tree_start_e9f4ffb2	alkay	I got a little carried away for a moment there. Is there anything else you would like to ask about?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	323
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_b94e6c1e	p	I noticed that you mentioned an "Elder Demeter"? Who exactly is that?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	331
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_03ed547a	alkay	Ah yes, Adam Demeter as you may or may not know him. We became close friends during the first contact conflict.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	333
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_55f5c4be	p	"Elder?"	game/ck_alkay.rpy	335
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_a2ff630e	alkay	Once a man or woman reaches a certain age and degree of experience they become an elder. It does not matter whether they are human or kaldrean.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	337
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_9408012e	p	Of course. Please continue.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	339
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_109500fd	alkay	It is thanks to him that the humans and kaldreans are speaking to one another, quite literally. In the time that he was working with us he learned to speak kaldrean common.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	341
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_4eced5ce	alkay	I, in turn, learned human common. He is a good man and he has endured quite a lot. Quite. I think no one should have to experience what he did.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	343
alkay_Bg_tree_adam_6684d232	alkay	If you go talk to him tell him I sent you, he will be happy to know what we have met. I advise that you avoid the topic of his past in the conflict, however.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	346
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_5b31fcf4	p	You mentioned a period of time after the military where you were on your own? What were you doing?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	353
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_60ccb99f	alkay	So after I stepped down from my position of high rank, I stayed with my family and settled them into a more comfortable property and lifestyle.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	355
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_60f55a71	alkay	I dumped all the money I had into their accounts and then took my leave into the wilderness of Qolisk, craving escape.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	357
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_5a64bf52	alkay	I built myself a cabin in a small oasis I discovered and stayed there in complete solitude. I became stronger, smarter, and more intelligent through my meditations.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	359
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_1ef1dc61	p	How did you decide when to stop?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	361
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_6f6d901a	alkay	I felt it. The same year that I made my journey back to Citadel was year one of Concord's construction. I was able to secure transportation from Qolisk to Bridge.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	363
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_6da2a4c7	alkay	Once I arrived I found that many of my former subordinates and some of my old friends were working on the Concord project.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	365
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_154195e2	alkay	Instead of settling down I actually walked to the other edge of the continent and back.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	367
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_9154bbe6	p	You're pulling my leg.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	369
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_9c01ed23	alkay	It took me a decade - and as a result we have vital information on the flora and fauna variation that exists on this continent.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	371
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_7774012d	p	That is ridiculous.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	373
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_35e56db2	alkay	But it is true. I was offered residence here and helped direct operations until construction was completed. At that point I just... decided to start a restaurant.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	375
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_c448b11f	alkay	I have the best location in the marketplace, and I am content here in my elder years.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	377
alkay_Bg_tree_experiences_5f20d878	p	I'm impressed, I can't say I've met anyone else with a history as decorated as yours.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	379
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_aee2f029	p	Listen, Alkay, I think that Valak Lideri are striving for a just cause. The corruption on Qolisk makes me sick if not uneasy.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	385
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_90faee26	alkay	Hmm... you are quite convicted in your assertion there. What changed so quickly?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	387
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_70f73d4d	p	I've just, been listening around to these rumors.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	389
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_2e93bd3f	alkay	And why are you coming to me about this?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	391
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_33b79642	p	You seem like you would have a strong moral alignment with them, based on your opinions about the kaldrean government.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	393
alkay_VL_plan_sympathy_d40ab3e5	alkay	While they do seem to share viewpoints with me, I do not think that I am a good source of information about them.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	395
alkay_VL_plan_lie_359dc8cd	p	Listen, Alkay, I know what Valak Lideri are and what they are planning. I want to help.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	402
alkay_VL_plan_lie_234ba5e4	alkay	Perhaps you have ingested some illegal substances, but I see that you are lying. Your voice says one thing but your mind, body, and essence say another.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	404
alkay_VL_plan_lie_51faef0b	alkay	I do not know what has changed so quickly, because it seemed that moments ago you were entirely trustworthy.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	406
alkay_VL_plan_lie_3d524587	p	That's not-	game/ck_alkay.rpy	408
alkay_VL_plan_lie_6c72cc65	alkay	Come back when you have decided to stop lying through your teeth, [alias.first].	game/ck_alkay.rpy	410
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_start_5690bb9a	p	Alkay, I can tell that you are part of Valak Lideri. If there is one thing that I have learned from you, it is how to read people.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	416
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_start_2d2ae4b0	p	You talk big, but you cannot hide your intent from me.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	418
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_start_a27d9f22	alkay	That is quite the accusation, [alias.first]. I strongly recommend against going about and riddling this city with accusations. Take care when treading about this subject.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	420
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_threaten_f3011188	p	Alkay, I will call in authorities if you do not tell me what Valak Lideri are planning to do.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	428
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_threaten_a375f8ff	alkay	Hah! You cannot scare me [alias.first]. Make all the threats you want, I guarantee none are as grave or intense as those I have dealt with previously.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	430
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_threaten_7d7882f2	alkay	I would like to stay level with you, [alias.first]. I will pretend like you did not just accuse me of terrorist associations.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	432
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_c240ca1b	p	I have talked with the people here - I know what kind of hardship they are enduring to see things change.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	438
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_6ecc0af1	alkay	I trust you, [alias.first]. I can see the spark of change in your eye.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	441
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_238773c1	alkay	The struggle that some face is far greater than you can understand, but I can tell that you know this. I can see that you genuinely want to understand it.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	443
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_931fe8cf	alkay	We will watch him from one end of a rifle scope. In an instant everything will change.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	445
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_91a68aec	alkay	[last_dialog]	game/ck_alkay.rpy	456
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_vatrisk_1b54afb5	p	Surely you can accomplish this change without killing the Ambassador.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	464
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_vatrisk_6d24cb38	alkay	Violence is never a good solution to a problem, but sometimes it is entirely necessary.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	466
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_vatrisk_c6c827b3	alkay	But honestly, hah, the only way around the his death would be if Vatrisk himself came out and denounced the kaldrean government.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	468
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_vatrisk_c3dddd7b	alkay	But that is not likely to happen any time this millennium.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	470
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_different_e46b5dc4	p	If you could go about this whole... situation differently how would you?	game/ck_alkay.rpy	476
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_different_29e88399	alkay	You cannot solve problems effectively by simply shooting your way through it. You can only solve them quickly.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	478
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_different_7c030a84	alkay	We have no choice now, but in my years of experience, even the deepest wounds are healed when words close wars.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	480
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_different_6cbae68f	p	But sometimes...	game/ck_alkay.rpy	482
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_approval_different_048d25e2	alkay	...we have to make concessions when faced with the greater good. We have no choice, and no amount of hoping things were different can make them change.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	484

alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_af770bd4	p	Alright I admit that I was embellishing the truth a little. I still want to see this change through, however. I can tell that we are close to accomplishing this goal.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	499
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_6548932b	alkay	I believe you, [alias.first], but your conviction falters. You are playing at the edge of the fire here on a scale you cannot possibly understand yet.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	501
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_irridiss_bbcd5da8	p	Alright then, I won't pretend that I can understand just how vast and important this change is. That does not change the fact that I'm on speaking terms with Irridiss.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	509
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_irridiss_76d05e5b	alkay	Then I suppose you know that the Ambassador always takes a stroll through the grove at sunrise? Sometimes we talk.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	511
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_irridiss_0b027297	alkay	Although, it ordinarily occurs without the gaze of a marksman carefully lining up his shot.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	514
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_irridiss_0ae81683	p	I see.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	516
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_important_7e200970	p	I have invested myself in this cause, Alkay. This is important to me. Trust me when I say I want to help Valak Lideri bring about this revolution.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	524
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_important_c5cee2a4	alkay	It is important to us too. That does not suddenly gain you access a change you cannot comprehend. A few days on Concord is not long enough to grasp it.	game/ck_alkay.rpy	526
alkay_VL_accuse_tree_hardship_embellishing_important_aa8a9926	p	What does that even mean? You aren't even giving me chance!	game/ck_alkay.rpy	528

kro_advice_36f311f1	p	Could you offer any advice to someone new to Concord?	game/ck_kro.rpy	50
kro_advice_2dd5bf72	kro	I will tell you what I have told others before you, and what I was told early on in my training: By choosing to come here you have agreed to change yourself.	game/ck_kro.rpy	52
kro_advice_e6cb9fcc	kro	You will be judged by a new set of rules and regulations, and who you become will be no one like who you left behind.	game/ck_kro.rpy	53
kro_advice_d0917dd1	p	That seems a little intense.	game/ck_kro.rpy	55
kro_advice_640705e2	kro	It is quite true. I recognize it in myself and those close to me.	game/ck_kro.rpy	57
kro_advice_e842c02d	p	And how does that affect you?	game/ck_kro.rpy	59
kro_advice_bc28cfe0	kro	I have yet to understand.	game/ck_kro.rpy	61
kro_advice_dc8cc915	p	Well... thank you for your words of advice.	game/ck_kro.rpy	63
kro_events_9e4a3006	p	Have you heard about this so-called tension between the humans and kaldreans here?	game/ck_kro.rpy	69
kro_events_44da98fa	kro	I do not spend too much of my operational time actually on Concord, I am simply here for the remainder of the week as my starship receives routine maintenance.	game/ck_kro.rpy	71
kro_events_8a09a594	kro	You are likely much better informed that I am on these matters.	game/ck_kro.rpy	73
kro_events_92807f33	p	You're probably right.	game/ck_kro.rpy	75
kro_events_4d1a6900	kro	Just ask around, if you have heard of these "rumors" then I am sure others have come into contact with the same fleeting words.	game/ck_kro.rpy	77
kro_events_7c015ac2	kro	If you have not already talked to Elder Volk in the Grand Marketplace then I recommend you do so. If not then perhaps Elder Demeter in the Residences.	game/ck_kro.rpy	78
kro_events_f352765b	p	Thanks for the direction.	game/ck_kro.rpy	80
kro_background_a5563a6a	p	Could you tell me about yourself Commander? How did you gain your rank?	game/ck_kro.rpy	86
kro_background_88c8225e	kro	I was born on Qolisk to a family of high political standing - surprisingly so.	game/ck_kro.rpy	87
kro_background_4382407d	kro	The Ross clan is put off for its support of the progressives, so it becomes increasingly difficult to work our way up the social ladder to high-ranking positions.	game/ck_kro.rpy	89
kro_background_08dcf11d	kro	Still, concrete results and hard numbers easily best a silly viewpoint. I was able to prove my worth and even surprise my conservative superiors.	game/ck_kro.rpy	91
kro_background_10a1bf68	kro	Eventually I could outdo even the best of them.	game/ck_kro.rpy	93
kro_background_597e7a4a	p	What do you do as a Flight Commander?	game/ck_kro.rpy	95
kro_background_949f8e0b	kro	I do exactly what my title dictates - I keep operational order over the flight crew on my ship, the KAU Voidrunner Triekri.	game/ck_kro.rpy	97
kro_background_ed445abd	kro	If something is not running smoothly I am responsible to see that the problem is solved.	game/ck_kro.rpy	99
kro_jon_tree_start_082d045b	p	I was talking with Jon and he referred me to you. I think that seems like a good idea.	game/ck_kro.rpy	105
kro_jon_tree_start_552f9812	kro	Officer Caise, yes. He is quite diligent. Whenever we dock for maintenance he makes sure everything on his end runs smoothly.	game/ck_kro.rpy	107
kro_jon_tree_start_417300b2	kro	However, I have noted from conversations with him that he is quite obsessed with weaponry. It worries me.	game/ck_kro.rpy	109
kro_jon_tree_start_57b81296	p	The obsession or specifically the weaponry?	game/ck_kro.rpy	112
kro_jon_tree_start_770cc88d	kro	The obsession. What did you and Officer Caise discuss that prompted a referral to me?	game/ck_kro.rpy	114
kro_jon_tree_VL_04c5c3b6	p	I had asked Jon about Valak Lideri and he sent me to talk to you - he said you might know more about them.	game/ck_kro.rpy	122
kro_jon_tree_VL_60f8f161	kro	I am familiar with the group, but unfortunately the extent of my knowledge does not continue beyond just that.	game/ck_kro.rpy	124
kro_jon_tree_VL_4d508147	kro	So I apologize. Perhaps you should find a linguist or an Elder - "Valak Lideri" sounds like a phrase from a traditional dialect.	game/ck_kro.rpy	126
kro_jon_tree_VL_36fe294f	p	Thank you for your help, Commander.	game/ck_kro.rpy	128
kro_jon_tree_obsession_6bc46ebf	p	You said obsession worries you. Why is that?	game/ck_kro.rpy	135
kro_jon_tree_obsession_f3daa2fc	kro	Throughout my career I have encountered a wide spectrum of both humans and kaldreans. Those with obsessions have usually caused me trouble.	game/ck_kro.rpy	137
kro_jon_tree_obsession_80b479a3	kro	That does not apply to everyone, for instance Officer Caise is very restrained and very professional about his obsessive hobby.	game/ck_kro.rpy	139
kro_jon_tree_obsession_d7df09d1	kro	However, the troubled individuals with darker compulsions are obsessed because they are burying information where they hope no one can find it.	game/ck_kro.rpy	141
kro_jon_tree_obsession_28eaf11c	kro	They can become reckless or paranoid, and then they begin to propagate disorder.	game/ck_kro.rpy	143
kro_jon_tree_obsession_1240ae76	p	Interesting. Thank you for the insight, Commander.	game/ck_kro.rpy	145
kro_VL_tree_start_88fac75a	p	What can you tell me about Valak Lideri?	game/ck_kro.rpy	151
kro_VL_tree_start_02ae8f01	kro	We may or may not have had this discussion already, but I am not as familiar with this group I assume you expect me to be.	game/ck_kro.rpy	153
kro_VL_tree_idea_3859d825	p	I just need an idea of what this group might be.	game/ck_kro.rpy	161
kro_VL_tree_idea_09cba9a5	lorisk	Clearly they are a rebel group with an obsession for change. I fear that they are going to lose sight of their pursuit, however, and turn their revolution into a bloodbath.	game/ck_kro.rpy	163
kro_VL_tree_idea_51fb96ff	lorisk	If they find assassination a proper method to make their statements, they are likely to overlook the fallout it would cause.	game/ck_kro.rpy	165
kro_VL_tree_who_566f8f83	p	In your expert opinion, who do you think could be involved with this group?	game/ck_kro.rpy	172
kro_VL_tree_who_19144737	kro	I would prefer not to make enemies out my acquaintances.	game/ck_kro.rpy	174
kro_VL_tree_who_0c8ae12f	p	I won't go around telling everyone what you've said. I don't see the point to that.	game/ck_kro.rpy	176
kro_VL_tree_who_c3468809	kro	Well, I suppose if I could make any guesses, they would be Mr. Demarc, Mr. Kriesk, and Ms. Nidaria. Do not take my words as law, however.	game/ck_kro.rpy	178
kro_VL_tree_who_312981c5	kro	Mr. Demarc underwent some profound changes and suffered substantial losses during the first contact conflict, he is troubled as a result.	game/ck_kro.rpy	180
kro_VL_tree_who_5933c409	kro	Mr. Kriesk has a deep-seated hatred from our military, despite the praise he received for his prowess with a ranged linear rifle.	game/ck_kro.rpy	182
kro_VL_tree_who_526ac9f8	kro	Ms. Nidaria has a generally progressive and sympathetic attitude. I could easily see her involved with Valak Lideri.	game/ck_kro.rpy	184
ck_lida_5d4288f8	lida	Yes?	game/ck_lida.rpy	11
ck_lida_80499b82	p	Uh, hello, ma’am. I’m [alias.full]. I -	game/ck_lida.rpy	12

lida_advice_b033bb7e	lida	Keep your mouth closed unless you have something intelligent to say.	game/ck_lida.rpy	36
lida_advice_1278313f	p	Alright. Thank you I suppose.	game/ck_lida.rpy	37
lida_events_f423dc49	p	Can you tell me anything about the political tension here on bridge?	game/ck_lida.rpy	42
lida_events_2abc7cf2	lida	Pay it no mind. Those rumors are nothing but rumors. It is a waste of your time to pay mind to something so absurd.	game/ck_lida.rpy	43
lida_events_fbe37aaf	p	Okay then.	game/ck_lida.rpy	44
lida_convince_tree_dc261397	p	Ms. Ezekeri, I would implore you to meet with Ambassador Columbus. I cannot understand why you decline such a simple request.	game/ck_lida.rpy	49
lida_convince_tree_c595177e	lida	Oh so I see he's found another fresh one to do whatever he asks? That is just rich.	game/ck_lida.rpy	51
lida_convince_tree_f13c7b74	lida	He has no authority to order me to meet with him. But I'll humor you - so go ahead and make your case [alias.title_last].	game/ck_lida.rpy	53
lida_convince_tree_intimidate_38f391b9	p	Ms. Ezekeri I know that Ambassador Irridiss has called you to meet with Ambassador Columbus. If you refuse to meet with Columbus you are disobeying Irridiss.	game/ck_lida.rpy	61
lida_convince_tree_intimidate_b7ccb9f9	p	That puts you under threat of insubordination charges.	game/ck_lida.rpy	63
lida_convince_tree_intimidate_17beaa86	lida	Ha! A threat! You clearly know little about how our system of obligations functions. Please do not make me laugh with your lack of intelligence.	game/ck_lida.rpy	65
lida_convince_tree_flatter_e79608b5	p	Ms. Ezekeri I can see that you are very wise - Ambassador Columbus, one of the most important figures in the galaxy, requires your professional input.	game/ck_lida.rpy	72
lida_convince_tree_flatter_24a5490c	p	He and I both have a deep respect for our elders.	game/ck_lida.rpy	74
lida_convince_tree_flatter_6b866bb3	lida	Hm... very well. You are a sharp one [alias.title_last]. I will accept Ambassador Columbus' request on your word.	game/ck_lida.rpy	76
lida_convince_tree_flatter_2ddd3125	p	On behalf of Columbus and myself, I would like to thank you.	game/ck_lida.rpy	78
ck_lorisk_8a7b8701	lorisk	I do not wish to speak with you again. Take your bigotry elsewhere.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	14
ck_lorisk_1e2f136a	lorisk	Hello, hola, ciao, bonjour, nǐ hǎo, konnichiwa, zdravstvuyte. Welcome to Concord!	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	21
ck_lorisk_6169d315	lorisk	I'm Lorisk Nidaria, the senior linguist and interpreter here in Concord. But please, just call me Lorisk.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	22
ck_lorisk_fa5ed282	p	Nice to meet you, Lorisk. I'm [alias.full], a recently-deployed diplomat.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	23
menu_lorisk_c7307e33	lorisk	[last_dialog]	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	29
lorisk_advice_522f4ba2	p	Do you have any-	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	47
lorisk_advice_76a258c9	lorisk	Advice? Always!	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	49
lorisk_advice_6640326b	p	How did you —	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	51
lorisk_advice_1f9d6293	lorisk	I talk to and interpret people for a living. You'd find that after doing something like that for so long, you develop an intuition to predict what someone is going to say.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	53
lorisk_advice_ffb02261	lorisk	Anyway, I'll tell you that acceptance is a big deal here.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	56
lorisk_advice_bcea669c	lorisk	The more you find yourself seeing through someone's skin and into their being, the more your definition of "person" will change.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	58
lorisk_advice_9ccaa72c	lorisk	While you may recognize someone as kaldrean in passing, when you get to know them you begin to identify them based on their presence in the room.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	60
lorisk_advice_d87e39ab	lorisk	You can understand a great deal about people based on their cadence of speech and energy they project.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	63
lorisk_advice_7ea1d548	p	I can see what you mean. Thanks for your advice, Lorisk.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	65
lorisk_events_c6c91888	p	What do you make of the political tension building here on Concord?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	71
lorisk_events_755359b9	lorisk	All I know is that we're working as hard as we can to keep tensions from building up any more. I'm afraid it's become increasingly difficult.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	73
lorisk_events_f2034c6c	p	Why is that?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	75
lorisk_events_d9888908	lorisk	Kaldreans and humans are just... more bitter recently and I'm not sure why. I have plenty of human friends and they haven't changed their attitudes.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	77
lorisk_events_33d6b754	lorisk	So I am confused. Perhaps it is because the ambassadors are relatively new and young - it seems kaldreans and humans share a distrust for youth without much life experience.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	79
lorisk_events_f15a6b24	p	I can see why they'd think that. I had to really struggle against that viewpoint to make it to where I am now.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	81
lorisk_events_524d51c7	lorisk	We are all doing our best to break down that disposition. I'm glad to see another young diplomat who projects the same charisma and authority as an Elder.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	83
lorisk_personal_reasons_4f0508ec	p	Can you tell me anything about Valak Lideri?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	89
lorisk_personal_reasons_136b1889	lorisk	Sorry I'd rather not.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	91
lorisk_personal_reasons_67cb4e30	p	Personal reasons?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	93
lorisk_personal_reasons_9ce49f76	lorisk	...yes. I apologize.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	95
lorisk_personal_reasons_7164a94a	p	Please, don't apologize to me. I was prying.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	97
lorisk_VL_tree_start_9783413f	p	You seem like you have quite a bit of interesting knowledge and experience. Can you tell me more about yourself and your background?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	104
lorisk_VL_tree_start_63e3d376	lorisk	Well, there isn't much to tell. Both my parents were linguists, and they made quite sure that I was prepared to communicate with anyone I met.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	106
lorisk_VL_tree_start_ba7a1443	p	Interesting.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	113
lorisk_VL_tree_languages_dc5f8785	p	So as the Senior Linguist here I assume you have a penchant for linguistics?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	118
lorisk_VL_tree_languages_c7307e33	lorisk	[last_dialog]	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	121
lorisk_VL_tree_languages_6ed177d5	lorisk	[last_dialog]	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	128
lorisk_VL_tree_dialects_d9faf4f2	p	Can you tell me about the traditional dialects? Alkay mentioned them so he got me wondering about them.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	132
lorisk_VL_tree_dialects_1d4d0746	lorisk	I actually know how to read and write in four of the many traditional dialects. Of those four I can speak and understand two: Kalaras and Takress.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	133
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_444f7ba8	p	Could you talk about the history of those two languages?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	141
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_60f7a34e	lorisk	Actually the reason I can speak and understand Kalaras and Takress is because they are still spoken, just barely anymore.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	143
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_22506562	lorisk	They are the more recent of the traditional languages that were prominent around the settlement of Sovereign Paradise.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	145
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_eaca6a49	lorisk	Although "Sovereign Paradise" is a modern adaptation of the original phrase, which would have meant "Beacon" back then.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	147
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_3652152e	lorisk	Kalaras and Takress were quite similar and eventually they were unified and enforced in education. This was the first iteration of Kaldrean Common.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	149
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_384e826c	lorisk	Different subcultures still spoke in their native dialects and still do today. Kaldrean Common has evolved quite a bit as a result of all the cultural input.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	151
lorisk_VL_tree_dialect_history_337d0cd8	p	Thank you for the information, Lorisk, this is really quite interesting.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	153
lorisk_VL_tree_list_languages_fbc6b9a2	p	So how many languages can you speak?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	160
lorisk_VL_tree_list_languages_1721f5eb	lorisk	I can speak thirty languages. Nineteen kaldrean and eleven human.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	162
lorisk_VL_tree_list_languages_0dbf2ac2	p	Thirty languages? Can you name each one?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	164
lorisk_VL_tree_list_languages_d36a1d63	lorisk	Do you really want me to list off all the languages I speak? Because I can.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	165
lorisk_VL_tree_list_all_lauguages_4e329d9a	p	Actually yes, I would.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	173

lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_b6def808	lorisk	Why thank you, [alias.first]. You're quite the charmer, aren't you?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	224

lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_4fab1a23	lorisk	I detect another statement - I'll warn you though, compliments and flattery are two very different concepts. I don't appreciate flattery.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	228
lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_more_ae22a98e	p	I did mean what I said, Lorisk. I know a few linguists back on Earth, none of whom possess the same repertoire that you do.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	236
lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_more_3eb1919f	lorisk	Alright. Let me give you some advice, [alias.first]: Be extremely cautious about compliments and flattery around kaldreans.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	238
lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_more_69236e58	lorisk	I've been tempered by my upbringing on Concord, but other kaldreans might be very easily offended by what you might consider an inane compliment.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	240
lorisk_VL_tree_flatter_more_3335af2d	p	I'll bear that in mind. Thank you Lorisk.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	242
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_start_2c0d83d7	p	Lorisk I know about your parents. I know that they are mixed-race.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	250
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_start_cc2fe05b	lorisk	Oh. You know about that? What do you care? Are you going to scorn me and my family for doing what they feel is right?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	251
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_61455d84	p	I just wanted to say that I think you and you're family are very courageous to be strong against the controversy you likely received.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	259
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_66495ddb	p	You and others like you deserve better than that.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	261
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_f6ee3919	lorisk	I-	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	263
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_9111d357	lorisk	You have no idea how hard it's been for us. For all of us. I just... can't stand to see anyone else go through what we have.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	265
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_ef3f569f	p	I'm doing my best to help.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	267
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_37345211	lorisk	Thank you. I cannot express enough just how much this means to me. I am desperate for this revolution to occur - it is the only way we have a chance to make it stop.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	269
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_3168dd21	p	You can trust me Lorisk. I want to help this rebellion to make the change it promises.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	277
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_8b0a0cb9	lorisk	I am willing to go to any length to make sure that we have a chance. Any measure...	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	279
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_ed25e216	lorisk	Any means will justify the ends provided that those like my family can be rid of the oppression and the slander and the hatred.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	281
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_b2530f49	lorisk	Valak Lideri is Beacon. When we restore it... not only will we spawn another golden age for kaldreans, but break down the barriers between our races.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	283
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_07747415	lorisk	It will be a new age for all of us.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	285
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_peace_0eb07175	p	Just remember that peaceful uprising will ultimately be the most effective. Minimize the grudges and the vengeance.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	295
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_peace_146b8782	lorisk	We cannot wait any longer, [alias.first]. We have already struggled for so long to give the progressive movement the ability to take down the corruption.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	297
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_peace_f984700b	lorisk	It never works. While I agree that peace minimizes the collateral damage, I simply do not think that we have a choice but to use force.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	299
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_peace_2cd45ae6	p	You may be correct. But if you must use the barrel of a rifle to argue your point, make sure you are aiming at the right people.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	301
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_889a2fb4	p	Make your point with the barrel of a linear rifle. From what I understand the progressive movement is extremely volatile - it would take little to set them off.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	307
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_207f43c6	lorisk	That's what we are planning - I just wish that there was a better way. I do not want my fellow kaldreans to perish for the corrupted controllers.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	309
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_5fbdf115	lorisk	Their lives are worthless. They do not deserve to have soldiers fight and die for them.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	311
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_211b9f55	p	You know that Vatrisk is doing his best to help you right?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	313
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_ba621da3	lorisk	I... I know. But this is out of my hands now. If we turn back now we may never accomplish what we have set out to change.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	315
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_violence_cb965f48	p	Then be very careful. I might not be able to help you once this gets going.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	317
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_reason_1ffcbc3b	p	When you bring the movement to Qolisk, make sure that the ones under the rifle scope are truly the ones responsible for the corruption.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	324
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_reason_49aca4dd	lorisk	I cannot agree with you more, [alias.first]. I cannot imagine how many poor souls are bent to do the bidding of our controllers. They should not trade their lives for leaders'.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	326
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_reason_be8528ab	lorisk	I'm afraid, however, that this will get out of hand.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	328
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_sympathy_confidentiality_reason_940d935f	p	The it is up to you to keep it under control. You can - you know strength better that most and I definitely know that you can communicate better than most.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	330
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_80350066	p	How exactly does that work? How does a kaldrean and a human fall into a relationship?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	336
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_051cc16f	lorisk	I cannot believe you really just asked me that? You did not really think that question through before you blurted it did you?	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	338
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_100ca155	p	No I'm actually -	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	340
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_b8a64b7c	lorisk	Stop. Stop before you say something even worse than that. You have no idea how much they have had to stand against to be together and to raise me.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	342
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_459a5baa	lorisk	They are happier together than most kaldrean or human couples. So not only did they have to face the fire, but I did as well.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	344
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_3db04b52	lorisk	I was shunned throughout my schooling and denied military service and the respect that kaldreans gain by going through it.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	346
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_cb78a30f	lorisk	So do not try to tell me that you understand, or that you want to. No words can express what we have gone through.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	348
lorisk_VL_plans_tree_disgust_ba6092c8	lorisk	I thought I could trust you, [alias.title_last], but I guess I couldn't recognize your deceitful tone. I do not want to talk to you anymore.	game/ck_lorisk.rpy	350
ck_noq_7f85c3fc	noq	I told you not to bother me.	game/ck_noq.rpy	11
ck_noq_2f5b0d33	noq	[last_dialog]	game/ck_noq.rpy	17
ck_noq_2770a8e6	noq	Yes?	game/ck_noq.rpy	19
ck_noq_715b41f8	p	I'm [alias.full]. Nice to meet you.	game/ck_noq.rpy	20
ck_noq_97c42fad	noq	Very good. Now please be snappy. I am very busy at the moment.	game/ck_noq.rpy	21
ck_noq_0a2fbbfd	p	Alright. I simply wanted to—	game/ck_noq.rpy	22
ck_noq_2f5b0d33_1	noq	[last_dialog]	game/ck_noq.rpy	24
menu_noq_ccaf2e89	noq	[last_dialog]	game/ck_noq.rpy	28
noq_advice_08e5b379	p	Would you mind sharing some advice?	game/ck_noq.rpy	46
noq_advice_19408aba	noq	Normally I wouldn't, but right now I am very busy. I have a deadline that I need to meet and right now I'm in the zone.	game/ck_noq.rpy	47
noq_advice_3a71e76c	p	Perhaps later then.	game/ck_noq.rpy	48
noq_advice_a00ef980	noq	Perhaps.	game/ck_noq.rpy	49
noq_advice_282ef3df	p	Alright.	game/ck_noq.rpy	50
noq_events_8079094b	p	What do you think about the whole "tension between kaldreans and humans" supposedly here on Concord?	game/ck_noq.rpy	55
noq_events_c611ec2e	noq	Ha. I was not aware of this. But that is probably because I do not pay mind to such matters. Clearly it is so obscure that it is not a real problem.	game/ck_noq.rpy	57
noq_events_38b1fff4	p	Alright then. I think that's clear enough. I'll let you get back to work.	game/ck_noq.rpy	59
noq_designs_b57d992e	p	So Noq, tell me about this new design you're working on.	game/ck_noq.rpy	66
noq_designs_e89cbc13	noq	Oh, yes this structure right here is...	game/ck_noq.rpy	67
noq_designs_abac4c99		Noq talks about his designs, and you get very board	game/ck_noq.rpy	68
noq_VL_tree_start_84245f00	p	Would you happen to know anything about Valak Lideri?	game/ck_noq.rpy	73
noq_VL_tree_start_ea837552	noq	You could ask anyone and they would be likely to give you a better answer than I.	game/ck_noq.rpy	75
noq_VL_tree_start_5bba6eb8	noq	Everyone knows about them just no one knows who they are or what they want. Kind of impractical for what is deemed a "rebel group" if you ask me.	game/ck_noq.rpy	77
noq_VL_tree_start_8bda66d3	noq	What was their most recent thing? A threat? Are they going to kill someone to make their point? How elementary.	game/ck_noq.rpy	79
noq_VL_tree_start_b156882d	noq	If they want to accomplish anything, they will have to re-think their strategy.	game/ck_noq.rpy	81
noq_VL_tree_start_cc7e845a	noq	All I see right now are tactical decisions - they might work in the short term, but they will fail long term.	game/ck_noq.rpy	83
noq_VL_tree_start_8e057a3a	noq	Our government has a strong outer shell but a weak internal structure - they should really focus on that instead.	game/ck_noq.rpy	85
noq_VL_tree_start_acbb5f90	p	You seem like you know quite a lot this.	game/ck_noq.rpy	87
noq_VL_tree_start_6773a448	noq	I dislike our government. But I'll deal with it as long as they no longer force obligations down my throat and then mock me when I am incapable.	game/ck_noq.rpy	89
noq_VL_tree_start_c786a4b5	p	I'm sorry I asked.	game/ck_noq.rpy	91
noq_VL_tree_start_fe2f21db	noq	Just don't ask. Let's avoid talking about my not-so-spectacular military past.	game/ck_noq.rpy	93
noq_VL_tree_start_ccaf2e89	noq	[last_dialog]	game/ck_noq.rpy	97
noq_VL_tree_ask_again_cecb4da6	p	Are you sure, Noq? I feel like you might have something more to say about Valak Lideri.	game/ck_noq.rpy	109
noq_VL_tree_ask_again_2be09cba	noq	I do not understand why you keep questioning me about this. I already told you that I do not know anything about Valak Lideri.	game/ck_noq.rpy	110
noq_VL_tree_assert_a9ebdab2	p	Surely you must know something. I can tell that you do.	game/ck_noq.rpy	118
noq_VL_tree_assert_f21f00ad	noq	You are irritating me with your ridiculous questioning. Remove yourself or I will have security remove you for you.	game/ck_noq.rpy	119
noq_interests_tree_start_739a3fd2	p	What interests you Noq? I'm guessing it's not a question you are asked often.	game/ck_noq.rpy	124
noq_interests_tree_start_b7601d66	noq	You are correct. I have a passion for mathematics and engineering - I can see these shapes and images that translate into numbers and measurements.	game/ck_noq.rpy	126
noq_interests_tree_start_6ea7839e	noq	When I put them into software everything simply works. I feel liberated when I am given architectural design work.	game/ck_noq.rpy	128
noq_interests_tree_start_79b2750f	p	How did you become interested? I assume you had a good education if you have such an expansive knowledge of this material.	game/ck_noq.rpy	130
noq_interests_tree_start_79a1f715	noq	I did. My family and my clan is wealthy. When my parents saw that I had a bent for engineering they put into the best educational system that money can buy.	game/ck_noq.rpy	132
noq_interests_tree_start_f76e0867	noq	Citadel's Academy is the most difficult school to get into, but I was practically invited.	game/ck_noq.rpy	134
noq_interests_tree_start_2dbd9965	p	So you're a savant basically.	game/ck_noq.rpy	136
noq_interests_tree_start_1b2f9836	noq	I suppose. That may also explain why I'm so socially and physically inept.	game/ck_noq.rpy	138
noq_interests_tree_start_f50f4c1e	p	Based on that I can infer that you had some troubles afterwards?	game/ck_noq.rpy	140
noq_interests_tree_start_b1b8da1d	noq	Military training... was absolutely terrible to me. I was unable to perform most of the tasks they asked of me, and I was ridiculed as a result.	game/ck_noq.rpy	142
noq_interests_tree_start_65ed0b0a	noq	I managed to regain some respect by becoming the youngest decorated master marksman in the last two centuries.	game/ck_noq.rpy	144
noq_interests_tree_start_35b250af	noq	The math skills really do come in handy when you can calculate projectile trajectories in your head and hit the center of the target every time.	game/ck_noq.rpy	145
noq_interests_tree_opinions_7e75c6cd	p	So you dislike the military? I suppose that's obvious... Can you be more specific? What is it about the military that turned you away?	game/ck_noq.rpy	153
noq_interests_tree_opinions_0a653ba6	noq	They have a certain expectation for every rookie soldier, even though it may be completely obvious that expectations are unreasonable.	game/ck_noq.rpy	155
noq_interests_tree_opinions_c0fdca61	noq	You get burned even though it is not your fault you were born with a physical defect.	game/ck_noq.rpy	157
noq_interests_tree_opinions_7a480854	noq	They are not permitted to kill you but they will try. They will have you within inches of death simply because they are trying to teach you "strength."	game/ck_noq.rpy	159
noq_interests_tree_opinions_8fb43b60	noq	Their system would work much better if it sought to put those with the right skills in the right training. But they do not. So they waste everyone's time.	game/ck_noq.rpy	161
noq_interests_tree_opinions_656a7dc2	noq	Alkay seems to think this accurate. I can definitely see why there are so many kaldreans out there who dislike the military and service to it.	game/ck_noq.rpy	163
noq_interests_tree_opnions_alkay_d5f3a08d	p	You mentioned Alkay?	game/ck_noq.rpy	171
noq_interests_tree_opnions_alkay_29598c75	noq	Right well, I think I got carried away.	game/ck_noq.rpy	173
noq_interests_tree_opinions_agree_7611eb97	p	I agree. Our military, while not compulsory like the kaldrean's, does uphold the same operational standards for everyone.	game/ck_noq.rpy	179
noq_interests_tree_opinions_agree_53717cfa	p	I feel like the way that they run things around there is inefficient and unbalanced as well.	game/ck_noq.rpy	181
noq_interests_tree_opinions_agree_959f299f	noq	You might talk to Officer Caise and Elder Volk. They know quite a bit about this as well.	game/ck_noq.rpy	183
noq_interests_tree_opinions_agree_bb8b3bce	p	Thank you	game/ck_noq.rpy	185
noq_interests_tree_sympathize_44c442b0	p	I'm sorry that you had to go through that. I don't think any military should treat their own people that way.	game/ck_noq.rpy	191
noq_interests_tree_sympathize_9ecfb564	noq	Do not patronize me, you do not truly understand how bad it was for some of us.	game/ck_noq.rpy	193
noq_interests_tree_sympathize_2a8e42bf	p	I'm sorry I said anything then.	game/ck_noq.rpy	195
noq_interests_tree_sympathize_206aa532	noq	Good.	game/ck_noq.rpy	197
ck_vatrisk_f960dc5d	vatrisk	Hello again, [alias.first], with what may I help you?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	16
ck_vatrisk_883d6ce1	p	I am doing well. I actually have a few more questions for you, if you have the time.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	18
ck_vatrisk_eb5c0667	vatrisk	[last_dialog]	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	21
ck_vatrisk_12aab861	vatrisk	[alias.full], welcome to Vivarioss! Or as you may know it, Concord. It is an absolute pleasure to make your acquaintance. I hope that another bright mind at work can make the cooperation and peace here even more resilient.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	24
ck_vatrisk_ea24c5c7	p	I am going to do my best.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	27
ck_vatrisk_eb3037af	vatrisk	And we will support you. Ambassador Columbus and I are committed to your success. Because your successes contribute to all of our successes.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	29

menu_vatrisk_c681ef65	vatrisk	[last_dialog]	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	37
vatrisk_advice_15aba03b	p	What advice would you have for someone like me?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	73
vatrisk_advice_0ff39f89	vatrisk	I definitely recommend going to Alkay's restaurant. You'd probably know it as Oasis. He makes the most delicious vaska.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	75
vatrisk_advice_2e3f3d23	p	Good to know, I'll keep that in mind. Anything else you could tell me?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	77
vatrisk_advice_6e1dfe71	vatrisk	Don't believe everything you hear. I've run into many liars in my life, and I've seen good people have their careers destroyed by no more than a few words.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	79
vatrisk_advice_1fb3c668	vatrisk	This shouldn't happen to anyone.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	81
vatrisk_advice_ba96940c	p	Thank you for the advice.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	83
vatrisk_events_5400a67e	p	So what's your take on all of this tension in the city?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	91
vatrisk_events_f19899ae	vatrisk	I can assure you that all of this tension is just plain hype. This is just some people getting used to the different cultures, and they will be used to it soon.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	93
vatrisk_background_aa70b5ba	p	What can you tell me about your past?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	100
vatrisk_background_4e1145e6	vatrisk	Well, I was born and raised on Qolisk, went through school just like everyone else, and joined the military.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	102
vatrisk_background_52a906bc	vatrisk	I produced some decent results and progressed through the ranks quite quickly.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	104
vatrisk_background_6cca4d59	vatrisk	When the government informed me that I was to be the new Ambassador I was thrilled. Not much of a story, but that's me.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	106
vatrisk_flatter_fc93b084	p	I don't think that anyone understands how hard you work to achieve peace here.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	112
vatrisk_flatter_67a92d29	vatrisk	Finally someone who sees through the shroud of lies and rumors. It's not easy being this kind of leader. Sure, our government is a little strict, but that's how it has always been.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	114
vatrisk_flatter_f6241000	vatrisk	The government is good to its people. Common resources are practically free, the populace is healthy, crime rates are low as ever.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	116
vatrisk_flatter_ad0f1b6e	vatrisk	Some kaldreans feel their freedom of speech is being cut down. While I can see their point, I would tell them that it is more complicated than oppression and censorship.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	118
vatrisk_flatter_61716c91	vatrisk	The people just don't understand that the balance of happiness, safety, and liberty is a nearly impossible task.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	120
vatrisk_intimidate_97196a7b	p	Tell me. Why are you making the government so harsh?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	128
vatrisk_intimidate_fcd50673	vatrisk	Excuse me?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	130
vatrisk_intimidate_37e52925	p	You heard me.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	132
vatrisk_intimidate_89aaba52	vatrisk	Talk to me when you have calmed down.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	134
vatrisk_bribe_35c2f1aa	p	Here, a gift from our embassy to yours.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	140
vatrisk_bribe_a90cdfd4	vatrisk	Ahh, so you're the one the guards were talking about! Tried to bribe your way into the embassy, didn't you?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	143
vatrisk_bribe_20a7dc4e	vatrisk	You could have simply asked, you know. Ambassador Columbus and I are willing to speak with anyone who comes up here.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	146
vatrisk_bribe_1c957b0a	vatrisk	The guards here are... simply doing their job.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	148
vatrisk_bribe_5ea9b594	vatrisk	I do not accept bribes anyway.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	150
vatrisk_bribe_846386a0	vatrisk	Oh my... I can buy a lot of vaska with this...	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	156
vatrisk_bribe_e48d8cbf	vatrisk	Please feel free to ask me anything.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	158
vatrisk_bribe_cd537f30	p	Well, I was hoping you could tell me why there are all of these rumors about the kaldreans feeling oppressed.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	160
vatrisk_bribe_25426cd8	vatrisk	Okay, look. It is not a simple matter. I have to deal with the pressure of being blamed for everything that this government does.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	162
vatrisk_bribe_d80ef910	vatrisk	Even though I do not agree with it all the time.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	164
vatrisk_bribe_032238e4	vatrisk	I wish there was a way to keep everyone happy and safe. It is practically impossible. Have you ever read Vel Kerriss' Dystopia?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	166
vatrisk_bribe_ad5164f5	p	I am not familiar with that work, no.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	168
vatrisk_bribe_6c6ed6b8	vatrisk	Well it basically describes our government - controversially of course. In short, we must balance law and liberty in order to keep the kaldrean people content.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	170
vatrisk_bribe_cb603819	vatrisk	Kerriss seemed to disagree, and having read the novel I understand his perspective. He raises a good cause against them.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	172
vatrisk_bribe_48bbc714	vatrisk	I feel what people fail to understand is that safety is more of a priority than happiness.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	174
vatrisk_bribe_ce678378	p	I kind of see what you mean.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	176
vatrisk_VL_denounce_0544e70f	p	You must denounce the kaldrean government.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	183
vatrisk_VL_denounce_956cc292	vatrisk	What?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	185

vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_start_ade57e3b	p	Irridiss, your life is in grave danger! Valak Lideri plan to kill you and take down the government.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	196
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_start_77accb47	vatrisk	Come again?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	197
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_ask_be54ddbf	p	You need to think. What is best for your people?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	208
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_ask_bd523749	vatrisk	The entire point of a government is to keep it's people safe, not happy. Sure, we may oppress them in some ways, but look at the crime rates. We prevent war!	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	210
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_no_change_17dcdc7b	vatrisk	There is no way that you can change my mind. I will never let this government fall.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	223
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_not_sure_75294fe5	vatrisk	But now I'm not so sure. I cannot tell who I should trust anymore.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	230
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_not_sure_a2af0853	p	The kaldrean government is weak right now. This rebellion will guarantee the change that your people seek.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	236
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_not_sure_1def81e5	vatrisk	I cannot risk the stability of the government for these rebels.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	238
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_not_sure_6eaaf19b	p	Your people are depending on you to fix this. Those rebels are just like you and I. They do not really want to kill you, but they will if they must.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	244
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_persuade_6eaaf19b	p	Your people are depending on you to fix this. Those rebels are just like you and I. They do not really want to kill you, but they will if they must.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	250
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_persuade_547b8cfd	vatrisk	Give me a moment to think.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	252
vatrisk_VL_inform_tree_persuade_ed63dd13	vatrisk	]You are right. "It's time for me to act."	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	254
vatrisk_VL_lure_ad68de72	p	Allow me to accompany you on your morning walk tomorrow. It would be my pleasure.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	261
vatrisk_VL_lure_d75b8528	vatrisk	Ah, of course my friend. I'd be happy to have you.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	265
vatrisk_VL_lure_c1c95307	vatrisk	Ordinarily my guards ask me to stay away from that area, but I trust you. I will meet you there at 08:00 tomorrow.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	267
vatrisk_VL_lure_1ec25df6	vatrisk	I am terribly sorry, but I will not be going out tomorrow morning as I will be busy.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	275
vatrisk_meeting_3396afca	vatrisk	Hello, Diplomat [alias.last]. How can I help you?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	283
vatrisk_meeting_b4fd8d59	p	I want to talk about recent political unrest in the city.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	285
vatrisk_meeting_6e8edcec	vatrisk	Oh. I see. But I was told you were here to discuss interstellar trade laws.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	287
vatrisk_meeting_b57fd657	p	I am sorry but that was not true. I'm actually here to discuss Valak Lideri. I have evidence that your life may be in danger.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	289
vatrisk_meeting_1f1850ac	vatrisk	Really? And what is this evidence?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	291
vatrisk_meeting_3a131647	p	Valak Lideri want to start a progressive revolution, and they are willing to go to any means necessary to accomplish that.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	295
vatrisk_meeting_29ecef59	p	Which includes assassinating you.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	297
vatrisk_meeting_e2538296	vatrisk	I find that quite unlikely, [alias.last]. I am perfectly safe here.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	299
vatrisk_meeting_203a2198	p	They think that the kaldrean people deserve liberation from the corrupted government. They see you as a figurehead for it. I can't argue with that.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	304
vatrisk_meeting_c205ba74	vatrisk	Well... I cannot quite argue with that either. There was a tumult for a while when I was first given office as Ambassador.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	306
vatrisk_meeting_8697528f	p	Valak Lideri wish to bring back what was previously known as "Beacon." They want to restore the golden age and make sure it lasts.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	310
vatrisk_meeting_64ff7098	vatrisk	That sounds unrealistic. Do they not realize how unstable they would make our people?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	312
vatrisk_meeting_6b23f79f	p	If you weren't aware, "Valak Lideri" means "Beacon." They are going to be the beacon for this revolution, and they are likely going to make an example out of you to start it.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	316
vatrisk_meeting_e670e181	p	Your death would be the wind underneath the wings of the progressive movement.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	319
vatrisk_meeting_dae8e1cc	p	I have no reason to lie to you, Ambassador. And I am quite assured tvatrihat the evidence all points to this.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	321
vatrisk_meeting_14872daa	p	Well, I don't actually have any proof but please, you have to believe me!	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	329
vatrisk_meeting_3be0c81b	vatrisk	Well, idle talk will not convince me of any threats.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	333
vatrisk_meeting_b1fb999c	vatrisk	Are you sure that all of this is true?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	339
vatrisk_meeting_9940b5a0	p	Absolutely.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	341
vatrisk_meeting_95ac507a	vatrisk	This information is definitely unnerving, but I'm still not entirely convinced. Tell me, why should I trust you, an Earthling diplomat who seems to have turned vigilante?	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	347
vatrisk_meeting_1e478340	p	Your people need you more than ever now. You shouldn't take any risks that would leave them helpless in such a time of need.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	354
vatrisk_meeting_34bbc7b2	vatrisk	You're right.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	356
vatrisk_meeting_c3bbd265	p	You need to trust us. We're only looking out for your best interests.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	362
vatrisk_meeting_804574d4	vatrisk	Humans never have had our best interests in mind!	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	364
vatrisk_meeting_2d6c80ec	p	These rebels are dangerous enemies of the peace. You should fear them.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	370
vatrisk_meeting_9bbee5f7	vatrisk	I don't need to fear those silly rebels.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	372
vatrisk_meeting_fail_578a1bee	vatrisk	Now, if you would excuse me, I have a transport to board.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	378
vatrisk_meeting_fail_dc87d558		The ambassador leaves the room and walks to his personal landing pad to board his transport. You follow him, still trying to dissuade him from leaving the safety of the High Embassy without guard.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	380
vatrisk_meeting_fail_386082d1		Ignoring your protests, he boards the transport. Soon after it takes off, you hear a deafening blast.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	389
vatrisk_meeting_fail_57776b7a		The ships seems to have been shot! It begins falling.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	410
vatrisk_meeting_fail_076c735c		Miraculously, the pilot manages to safely land the critically wounded craft as close as she can to the landing pad.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	429
vatrisk_meeting_fail_73792581		Ambassador Irridiss steps out, clearly shaken, but seemingly uninjured.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	433
vatrisk_meeting_fail_9c617602	vatrisk	You were right! They tried to kill me. But how did you know? This makes no sense...	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	437
vatrisk_meeting_fail_d149ad43	vatrisk	You were right! Thank you for trying to save my life.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	442
vatrisk_meeting_fail_20a2e5f0	p	We need to get you to safety!	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	444
vatrisk_meeting_fail_91d565d3	vatrisk	Right away! Guards!	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	446
vatrisk_meeting_success_92291f15	vatrisk	Well, I was about to leave to board a transport, but I'm not sure anymore. My life could be in danger. I trust you, [alias.full].	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	453
vatrisk_meeting_success_e1f2a549		You and the ambassador sit and talk about Valak Lideri for a bit longer. Then, you hear a sudden, deafening blast from outside Kier's office.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	455
vatrisk_meeting_success_c862c556		The sounds of an aircraft plummeting to the ground come from outside.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	462
vatrisk_meeting_success_29b542f6	vatrisk	That was my transport! You saved my life. I am eternally grateful. If you need anything, you have my full trust.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	468
vatrisk_meeting_end_9cf42e9c		You return to Sarah to discuss what you've witnessed.	game/ck_vatrisk.rpy	475
menu_high_emb_9745b93f	guard	Haven't we already talked to you? Unless you have official business here, you may not enter the High Embassy.	game/script.rpy	334

high_emb_guard_menu_9ffe0c79	p	[alias.full].	game/script.rpy	344
high_emb_guard_menu_940ec0aa	guard	Sorry, but I don't see you on my list.	game/script.rpy	345

intro_41204718		Fifty years ago, humans made first contact there with the kaldreans, an advanced race of insect-like beings.	game/sequences.rpy	14
intro_253fe21a		At first, there was fighting between the two races, but later that year, the two signed a treaty of friendship and peace. 	game/sequences.rpy	17
intro_e0ad1baf		Bridge was settled and the capital city of Concord was constructed. Since then, Concord has served as a shining beacon of peace in which humans and kaldreans live as one.	game/sequences.rpy	20
intro_cf2e85ff		The peace of Bridge is essential to the peace of the rest of the galaxy. If human-kaldrean relations on the planet break down, then the rest of the galaxy is bound to follow suit.	game/sequences.rpy	23
intro_ad8fc8e1	comm	And this is why I have called you here today, Agent. The great city of Concord has of late been troubled by political unrest.	game/sequences.rpy	28
intro_2c7e797d	comm	A mysterious group of rebels known as "Valak Lideri" has infiltrated Bridge's government and has induced tensions between humans and kaldreans.	game/sequences.rpy	31
intro_e36a791b	comm	It has come to my attention that the life of the kaldrean High Ambassador may be under threat from this group.	game/sequences.rpy	33
intro_7e9d04e4	comm	On this assignment, you shall travel to Concord. You will act under alias a diplomat, investigating the situation and learning about Valak Lideri.	game/sequences.rpy	35
intro_a3c7200d	comm	You will work with Agent Redmont, a well-respected special agent such as yourself, who is currently stationed in the city under alias as the scientist Sarah Liu.	game/sequences.rpy	38
intro_feded859	comm	Then, when you are ready, it is up to you to take action and apprehend those who plan to cause mayhem in the great city.	game/sequences.rpy	41
intro_efa9220f	comm	Do not take this mission lightly. The people of Bridge will not be so willing to answer the prying questions of an Earthling diplomat.	game/sequences.rpy	44
intro_7a2cda13	comm	How you decide to act may very well be the difference between order in chaos on Bridge.	game/sequences.rpy	47
intro_6c33f41f	comm	And if the peace of Bridge should be broken, then it is only a matter of time before the rest of the galaxy falls with it.	game/sequences.rpy	50
intro_8b27ce7d	comm	Before you go, you must complete your alias as a diplomat.	game/sequences.rpy	53
intro_e7842160	comm	Very good. It is time for you to get going, then, Agent.	game/sequences.rpy	70
intro_b95bfbf3	comm	You have not failed me yet. Do not let this be the first time you do.	game/sequences.rpy	71
intro_36a7dc55		After a month-long journey through space, you finally arrive on Bridge. As you come to land at the Spaceport, you see Concord below you.	game/sequences.rpy	75
intro_6b10565e		The city appears Utopian, set between a shimmering coast and an luscious jungle.	game/sequences.rpy	78
intro_33c9b208		Your ship descends to the Spaceport.	game/sequences.rpy	79
intro_87a0a02c		You dismount your spacecraft, stumbling a bit as you readjust to the feeling of gravity. You emerge in the bustling, noisy spaceport. People mill about all around.	game/sequences.rpy	84
intro_b19447f5		You open your assignment notes, which tell you to meet Agent Redmont in the Residences as soon as you arrive.	game/sequences.rpy	87
ending_correct_plans_8690b6c8		Agent Redmont goes to initiate the raid.	game/sequences.rpy	94
ending_correct_plans_6abc3de4		You know what Valak Lideri are planning and therefore it is easy for you to stop them.	game/sequences.rpy	95
ending_correct_plans_6537394b		In the process you apprehend the suspects. When they are tried in court they are found guilty. However, cannot bring yourself to meet their gazes.	game/sequences.rpy	96

ending_not_enough_rebels_identified_6088ed7f		Those who accuse of association with Valak Lideri are investigated, but it does not stop the assassination of Ambassador Irriddiss.	game/sequences.rpy	109
ending_not_enough_rebels_identified_cb504b76		You did not identify enough of the rebels, which leaves the others to carry out the assassination anyway. Albeit without additional support.	game/sequences.rpy	110
ending_correct_rebels_5790e4b5		You correctly identified the rebels. You and Agent Redmont easily apprehend them.	game/sequences.rpy	114
ending_correct_rebels_fbd1a97d		When they are tried in court they are found guilty. However, cannot bring yourself to meet their gazes.	game/sequences.rpy	115

ending_vatrisk_lure_b5e256ec		Vatrisk falls to the ground, fatally wounded.	game/sequences.rpy	125
result_1_fcf22950		As a result of your failure to act to prevent the assassination, the rebels carry out their plans unhindered.	game/sequences.rpy	136
result_1_063b2780		Irridiss is killed but the lack of discretion and precision renders it easy for authorities to catch up to and apprehend the human rebels.	game/sequences.rpy	137
result_1_46de9bb8		The spark that Valak Lideri hoped to light did not take properly and the rebellion they wanted to occur never lifts off.	game/sequences.rpy	138
result_1_394e2163		The loss of a figurehead of peace between the humans and kaldreans quickly causes relations to break apart and violence to intensify.	game/sequences.rpy	139
result_1_33da5d99		War breaks out on Bridge and the infant alliance between the kaldreans and humans is destroyed, leaving both embroiled in conflict.	game/sequences.rpy	140
result_1_da13851b		However, the alliance is restored after the bitter races eventually forget what they are fighting about and set their differences aside once again.	game/sequences.rpy	141
result_2_39e0efdf		Your sharp eye for detail and ability to determine critical information allows you to do what you were assigned to do: apprehend Valak Lideri.	game/sequences.rpy	150
result_2_1c566566		Valak Lideri is stopped dead in its tracks and the assassination is not carried out. The impetus behind the progressive movement breaks apart and leaves it to fizzle out.	game/sequences.rpy	151
result_2_1910080e		The tentative peace between the two races continues and slowly strengthens but the kaldrean government remains corrupted.	game/sequences.rpy	152
result_2_50b87ceb		Bridge remains the safe-haven for those kaldreans and humans with progressive attitudes and the kaldrean government keeps blinders over the eyes of their people.	game/sequences.rpy	153

result_3_66dd65b1		Your shift in perspective has you helping Valak Lideri to carry out their assassination with dramatic cleanliness and precision.	game/sequences.rpy	164
result_3_77291395		The kaldrean military declares war upon the humans but soon find themselves overwhelmed by the massive uprising on Qolisk.	game/sequences.rpy	165
result_3_95dce297		The military breaks off to quell the rebellion, but by that time it is far too late. The movement is bloody but lighting quick.	game/sequences.rpy	166
result_3_97e73ca6		While the collateral damage brings the kaldrean home world to its knees, the instantiation of a new democratic republic is a beacon of hope for the kaldrean people.	game/sequences.rpy	167
result_3_7a8b57f9		With the tyrannical government obliterated, the knew leaders are swift to reform their alliance with the humans.	game/sequences.rpy	168
result_3_994c7288		What was a previously tentative alliance is reinforced and ultimately leads to stronger and more stable relations between the two races.	game/sequences.rpy	169
result_4_272fab33		Your skill with words convinces Ambassador Irridiss to publicly denounce the kaldrean government. Valak Lideri do not carry out an assassination.	game/sequences.rpy	178
result_4_8f10f611		The shock wave of Irridiss' words are so profound that the progressive movement swells and even pulls in some conservative sympathetics.	game/sequences.rpy	179
result_4_5417ab8f		The human military coupled with the progressive movement descends upon the corrupted controllers with deadly accuracy.	game/sequences.rpy	180
